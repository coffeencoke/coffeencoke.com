          I am a Team Lead Senior Software Engineer at Asynchrony, 
          downtown St. Louis.
        %p 
          My current project is to completely transform the recruiting 
          system for my client.  This comes with plenty of challenges to
          keep me on my toes.
        %p
          Along with leading my project, I am very interested in company
          culture, and quality of who I work with, what we work on,
          how we work on it, and why.

          This presentation is about fear, and how fear can effect how I make decisions
          in my career as a programmer. My hope is to challenge you, and that you would
          challenge me with ideas on how we can conquer fear, how we can make our projects
          better, our teams stronger, our industry more valuable, and encourage each other
          to become better people.
        %p
          Ever experienced the pain of a God class? I have some theories on how you can,
          among many things, conquer even the God class.

          DMD Brands hired me to help kickoff their internal software
          team. I provided a framework to help them understand
          how to develop software professionally for their products in a
          quality way. I interviewed developers, and gave recommendations,
          and I developed software with them to get them started.

          server, I used phonegap with html5, css, and javascript, for the
          mobile delivery strategy, tested with jasmine, and cucumber. And
          used ruby with Amazon's DynamoDb for the server.
