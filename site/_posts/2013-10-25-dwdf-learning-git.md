To the designers who went freelance, and dove into programming with an emphasis on design and front end development.  This is for you.

Programming can be difficult, and learning to program when you have an emphasis on the design skills can be even frustrating at times.  That's why you should take some time to learn some tools to improve your abilities, make life less difficult and frustrating, and improve your product.

This is the first of a series of blog posts I am tagging [DWDF](/blog/tags/dwdf.html), titled "Dear Web Design Freelancer".  I am doing this with the goal of providing some beginner tools to help web designers increase their web development abilities.
