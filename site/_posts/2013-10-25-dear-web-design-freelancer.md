To the designers who went freelance, and dove into programming with an emphasis on design and front end development.  This is for you.

Programming can be difficult, and learning to program when you have an emphasis on the design skills can be even frustrating at times.  That's why you should take some time to learn some tools to improve your abilities, make life less difficult and frustrating, and improve your product.

This is the first of a series of blog posts I am tagging [DWDF](/blog/tags/dwdf.html), titled "Dear Web Design Freelancer".  I am doing this with the goal of providing some beginner tools to help web designers increase their web development abilities. View a layout of the vision of this post on the [dwdf github repository](https://github.com/coffeencoke/dear_web_design_freelancer).

## Strategy

I wish to provide you with three examples for a series of topics.  If you commit yourself to learning these topics, I guarantee that you will improve your process, your product, and hopefully, your enjoyment. 

*Please realize that my day job emphasizes on very complex software development, but I have experience in design, UX / Front End development, and I will try to present these topics in a way that you can appreciate*

1. [Introduction to Software Source Control - never lose a thing, hack away safely.](/blog/2013/10/29/introduction-to-software-source-control/)
2. Develop Locally - keep production happy
3. Deploy With Ease - No more hacking around with production servers
4. Automate Your Deployments - Ship your work more efficiently
5. Control Your Quality - Develop in peace, demonstrate with flexibility, test before production, and be at peace.

These are my five topics thus far, if you have other topics that you wish to see, please let me know.

### Extras

Extras that I don't want to commit to right now are

* SASS and HAML
* Coffeescript
* Javascript Testing
* Object Oriented Javascript
* Designing with a Grid
* Compass
* Cloud Servers
* SSL Certificates
