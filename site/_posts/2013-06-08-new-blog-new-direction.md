## New Blog

I have decided to kill off the name that I have been using for my programming blog and twitter account, Railsgrammer, and use my personal handle for everything, Coffeencoke.

In doing so, I also was tired of maintaining wordpress for myself and having scalability issues with my server, and requiring database backups and time consuming moments of migrating the blog to a new server.

## New Tools

I also want to learn and use new tools.  It's time to say goodbye to Wordpress, and hello to Jekyll.

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is open source code that will "Transform your plain text into static websites and blogs".  I have been using Jekyll for a number of things lately:

* API Documentation
	* Editable for developers and the core team by using [Gollum](https://github.com/gollum/gollum)
	* Readonly for consumers by using [Gollum Site](https://github.com/dreverri/gollum-site)
* My blog
* Team wiki for my projects

I think that it is a fantastic idea, and I am so glad that I will be able to develop my blog and portfolio website without the clunky setup for a wordpress environment.

I encourage you to take a look at these and thanking the creators of them for providing such excellent tools:

* [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)
* [Gollum](https://github.com/gollum/gollum)
* [Gollum Site](https://github.com/dreverri/gollum-site)

## Hosting no mas

Also, I will not need to host my blog somewhere, pay for it, maintain it, and keep an eye out for whether it is up or not, thanks to [Github sites](http://pages.github.com/) and [custom domains](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages)!

Freaking awesome!

## New Direction

I've been developing software professionally since 2005.  I am self taught and driven.  Back then, I had a bit more *play time* than I do now, and understandably so.

As my wife and I continue in the path of our careers together, I want to intentionally grow in the following:

* Computer Science - Algorithms, Data Structures
* Other Languages - Expanding my exposure to other languages
* Community - Give back to the community and be a part of pushing technology forward
* Business - Entrepreneurial knowledge and growth

### Computer Science

I have a strong knowledge of how to develop good software, how things should be designed, and how code should be designed. But most of that is from experiences, and by thinking through past decisions and applying it to future decisions.

However, I do not have the depth of a computer science degree when it comes to understanding algorithms and data structures. So I want to grow in that.

### Other Languages

I'm proficient in Ruby, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Have had experience in PHP, Java, C#, and ObjectiveC. But I want to broaden my experience with other languages, such as Haskel, Lua, Scala, Erlang, Node.js, Go, and anything else that sounds interesting.

### Community

Lately I've been wanting to be more involved with the community in many ways, specifically at conferences and local meet up groups. I also want to be involved to help others learn how to become better developers.

### Business

I have a passion for being an entrepreneur, I want to learn how I can follow that passion as effectively as possible.  This includes accounting, networking, ideas, branding, and development if all of what it takes to create a business or product.

## Wrapup

I'm excited to begin sharing what I have to share about these topics, if you have any direction, suggestions, or encouragement, please let me know.
