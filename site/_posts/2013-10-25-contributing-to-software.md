This is only my current approach to contributing software, this is not **THE** guide to contributing, and I am sure it will evolve over time.  If you have other methods, or modifications to this, please [send me a message on twitter](https://twitter.com/coffeencoke).

There are many blog posts about this already, but I wanted a place to keep my current guide for my projects.  To view others, you can go to most github projects and look at the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) files.

For my projects, all I care about are the following:

## Acceptable Etiquette

1. Fork the repository on Github
2. Create a branch with a topical name for your change
3. Make small stable commits
4. Update tests for changed code
5. Write new tests for new code
6. Make a pull request

## Bonus Points

1. Create an issue first to discuss the feature with me and others
2. Update documentation along with your changes.  This may need to happen after the pull request is merged in.
3. Split your pull requests up in smaller units of work so we can pick and choose what we want to merge, and what we want to improve.
4. Always make your pull request improve the code
5. Add yourself to the contribution list

That's all I have, enjoy.
