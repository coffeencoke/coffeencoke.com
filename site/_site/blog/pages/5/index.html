So I have been having issues where my <strong>macbook pro</strong> running Mac OSX 10.5 <strong>would not connect to hotspots</strong> at coffee shops, hotels and the like!  Very frustrating because <strong>it used to work</strong> and I could not figure out why it wouldn't work all of the sudden.  <strong>I could connect to the router</strong> and I received an IP Address but when I opened Firefox or Safari the landing page for that hotspot, you know: the page where you either enter a hotspot login or just click go, well, it never loaded.  It would time out :(

I am at a hotel in Penn State hoping to do some blogging and searching and a little research / unplugagoogling and really wanted to get this internet thing to work.  Luckily I had my iPhone and could browse with the 3G network and I had the patience (rare in times of needing internet).  So I browsed on my iphone while applied changes to my macbook pro.

The odd thing was that I could send / receive emails, login to my chat clients, load my dashboard data. <strong> I could ping but not browse</strong> in firefox or safari.  Yuck!

Looking at the logs in console didn't help, I removed my Cisco VPN Client because I read a few things about that client installing a kernal module that breaks that functionality, I opened up my firewall and all of this did not solve the issue.
<h2>Solution</h2>
Finally, I realized I installed <strong>Peer Guardian</strong>, which is a great application, but it was blocking all access for that landing page (I could see it blocking from the peer guardian log output).  So <strong>I disabled the Peer Guardian filters</strong> and refreshed google and vualah! <strong>it worked</strong> :)... now to figure out how to add this situation to the allow / exception list, a task for another day.

This may not be the solution for you, if it didn't work then hopefully it's at the very least some direction to get you moving toward the solution.

  <div class="entry-content"><img class="size-full wp-image-10 alignright" title="terminal_2" src="http://railsgrammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/terminal_2.png" alt="terminal_2" width="189" height="124" /><strong>How to use bash alias commands to your advantage</strong>

Using command line tools saves a developer an unbelievable amount of time.  The question is how do you save more time and increase your efficiency even more?

One of my favorite ways is one I've used a long time, by using bash aliases.  This post is directed to Mac OS X but may work with some linux distros as well, files are named differently.

How can this help you?  Lets say everytime you open a shell window you have to cd into a generally deep project directory like:
<blockquote>
<pre>/Users/mattsimpson/Clients/My\ Client/Web/Email\ Dispatch\ App/branches/0_8_0_1_ccd_migration</pre>
</blockquote>
This can be tedious and annoying very easily, especially if you like to keep your folder names standard english format like "My Client" rather than cammal case "MyClient" or "my_client", etc.

With Aliases we turn this:
<blockquote>
<pre>
<pre>[msimpson@dakota ~]$ cd /Users/mattsimpson/Clients/My\ Client/Web/Email\ Dispatch\ App/branches/0_8_0_1_ccd_migration</pre>
</pre>
</blockquote>
Into this
<blockquote>
<pre>[msimpson@dakota ~]$ email_dispatch_app</pre>
</blockquote>
which you can tab out after emai → [tab], that's jimmy johns fast.

<strong>How do I get there?</strong>

First, Open a terminal window and edit your <strong>.bash_login</strong> file (.bashrc for linux) with your favorite text editor:
<blockquote>
<pre>[msimpson@dakota ~]$ vi ~/.bash_login</pre>
</blockquote>
And <strong>Insert</strong> the following near the end of the file:
<blockquote>
<pre># Alias definitions.
# You may want to put all your additions into a separate file like
# ~/.bash_aliases, instead of adding them here directly.
# See /usr/share/doc/bash-doc/examples in the bash-doc package.

if [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then
 . ~/.bash_aliases
fi</pre>
</blockquote>
<strong>Save</strong> and close.

Create a <strong>new file</strong>, let's name it <strong>.bash_aliases</strong> in your home directory:
<blockquote>
<pre>[msimpson@dakota ~]$ vi ~/.bash_aliases</pre>
</blockquote>
and <strong>insert</strong> the following into the first line of the newly created file, but replace the alias name (email_dispatch_app) with your desired command alias name and the command path (/Users/mattsimpson/Clients/My Client/Web/Email Dispatch App/branches/0_8_0_1_ccd_migration) with your desired command path...
<blockquote>
<pre>alias email_dispatch_app='cd /Users/mattsimpson/Clients/My\ Client/Web/Email\ Dispatch\ App/branches/0_8_0_1_ccd_migration'</pre>
</blockquote>
<strong>Save</strong> and close.

<strong>Execute</strong> the following command to <strong>reset your bash session</strong>:
<blockquote>
<pre>[msimpson@dakota ~]$ . ~/.bash_login</pre>
</blockquote>
You are now able to execute your command (email_dispatch_app) and it's <strong>tab completable!</strong> Go ahead and try it and see below for my list of aliases I have collected through the past couple years.
<blockquote>
<pre>[msimpson@dakota ~]$ email_dispatch_app</pre>
</blockquote>
<strong>Obviously</strong> you can see how this can speed up your development and allow you to <strong>focus on the things that matter</strong>, not on where you need to change directories, or that super long command that you always have to type in over and over.

Here is the list of aliases I have, feel free to contribute your aliases, I'd love to see how others are using aliases.

my .bash_aliases file:
<blockquote># General Use Aliases
alias l='ls -lh'
alias c='clear'
alias cx='chmod +x'
alias tree="find . -print | sed -e 's;[^/]*/;|____;g;s;____|; |;g'"

# Ruby / Ruby on Rails Aliases
alias cons='./script/console'
alias gen='./script/generate'
alias spec='./script/spec'
alias srv='./script/server -u'
function import_email { email_dispatch &amp;&amp; ./script/runner "IncomingEmailHandler.direct_mail(STDIN.read, '$1')"; }

# Project Directory Shortcuts
# ...
# a bunch of directory shortcuts
alias email_dispatch_app='cd /Users/mattsimpson/Clients/My\ Client/Web/Email\ Dispatch\ App/branches/0_8_0_1_ccd_migration'
# ...

# SSH Shortcuts
# ...
# a bunch of ssh commands so i don't have to remember users and ip addresses like:
alias sshenvion='ssh msimpson@xx.xx.xx.xxx'
# ...

# Services
alias mysqlservice='sudo /Library/StartupItems/MySQLCOM/MySQLCOM'
alias recover_scanner="cd /var/www/projects/cdops2/current/ &amp;&amp; sudo ./script/runner -e production "IncomingEmailHandler.recovery_scanner""
function mksvn { ssh msimpson@trogdor setupsvn.sh $1; }
# instead of
# $ svn checkout -m 'some svn message'
# you do
# $ svc some svn message
function svc { svn commit -m "'$*'"; }
function checkout { svn checkout svn+ssh://trogdor/var/svnroot/$1; }</blockquote>
My favorite is by far the srv and the svc commands.  Enjoy :)

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The name&#8217;s Matt Simpson, I&#8217;m a soccer ninja, business connoisseur, music engineer and Ruby on Rails a holic.</p>

<p>Since this blog&#8217;s focus is toward Ruby on Rails I&#8217;m giving myself permission to allow this post a little freedom.</p>

<p>My Life, generally:</p>

<p>I was born in a small town and raised in a house in the country.  All I had to keep me busy was my brother, best friend, my creativity and the adventures we thought up!  I suppose creativity was a part of my life from the git go.  Probably why I am always churning ideas around and never in boredom.  My boredom contains a canvas and it is never blank.</p>

<p>I am the youngest of 4, being in that position I grew up very determined, competitive and driven.  Some people tell me I am not a type A but have 2 A&#8217;s in my personality.  I love a challenge and figuring out the how to make anything more efficient.  I also love designing and composing music.  With those 2 combinations you get a very interesting person.</p>

<p>As far as programming&#8217;s concerned, well, It all started in the 4th grade.  What better year to begin programming?  I took a class on QBASIC and my curiosity - on how computers work - began.  It opened my eyes that computers are not just some magical things found in a foreign tiny little island with jungles and monkeys and cobras.  I began developing websites in 7th grade, where I spent some of my time engrossed in developing hideous (now hideous, then genius) websites about my life in the fast junior high culture :).  Throughout high school I stepped my web development knowledge more and more, bit by bit.  My first paid contract was my junior year in high school for a flash website and it all started to come together as to why I was spending so much time on the computer nights after nights, mornings after early mornings.</p>

<p>I went to the Art Institute in Schaumburg Illinois majoring in Interactive Media Design in 2006 when I landed a job as a web developer at Wencel Worldwide downtown Chicago.  I quickly realized that with the power of the internet, school was slowing me down in regards to my web development strength.  What I could teach myself in 1 year I would learn at school in 4, and by the time I graduated, what I learned would be obsolete at the exponential rate the internet moves.  I quickly realized if I were to make it in this industry I needed to unleash myself from school so that I could continue to learn the latest and greatest in web development.</p>

<p>After working at Wencel Worldwide full time for a while I landed a job in Saint Louis Missouri as the lead web applications developer at Customer Direct in 2007.  I have been working there as the Lead Ruby on Rails web developer of a team of 4 programmers and 3 systems admins.  I&#8217;ve been focusing my efforts on Ruby on Rails, mentoring the other developers, and teaming to develop some very innovative applications.</p>

<p>In June of 2008 I started a web development solutions company, Envion Studios LLC, focusing on Ruby on Rails and PHP development.  Since then, numerous opportunities have opened up and blossomed into great growing points in my life.</p>

<p>I played baseball and soccer in high school.  Started varsity my sophomore, junior and senior year for soccer, loved every minute of the season.  I played the trumpet in marching band, section leader my sophomore, junior and senior years as well.  I truly believe that being a part of sports and marching band has shaped my life more than anything imaginable.</p>

<p>Music is a huge part in my life.  I play drums, guitar, piano (primary) and I sing.  Mainly as an outlet of my creativity and of life, but also as a way to express what&#8217;s going on inside.  Music is the language of the soul.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy this blog, I feel contributing back to the community of the internet is an amazing privilege and I am so glad that the internet has become as powerful of a tool as it has.  I have learned much from it, and only hope to contribute a smidgen of knowledge back.</p>

<p>Feel free to check out my personal blog at <a href='http://www.coffeencoke.com' target='_blank' title='My personal blog'>Coffee n' Coke</a> where I ramble about my life, culture, friendships and my walk with christ.</p>

<p>Thanks and enjoy</p></div>
