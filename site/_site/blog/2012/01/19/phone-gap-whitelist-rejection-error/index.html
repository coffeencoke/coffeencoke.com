My mobile app continues.  As I was testing my registration API through the iOS emulator I got the following error:
<pre>MyApp [97185:15603] ERROR whitelist rejection: url='http://localhost:3000'</pre>
After some quick google searching, I discovered that in order to make requests outside of the file system I had to add the host to the phone gap's plist file.  For my project this file is located at <code>/MyApp/PhoneGap.plist</code>.  You can either edit this file with a text editor or edit it in Xcode.  The end result for me to be able to hit localhost within the app looks like this:
<pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
...
&lt;key&gt;ExternalHosts&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;array&gt;
&lt;string&gt;localhost&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;/array&gt;
...</pre>
After I made that change, I restarted my app through Xcode and the app was able to hit the rails server.
