To truly be vulnerable we really have to be selfless and let others to \"see\" into us (true intimacy = into me see) without other distractions in the way (thinking of those other distractions is only one more aspect of what you were already talking about - which I totally agree with - just wanted to add this too).  I\'ve known a few people in my life where they seemed so transparent that it was scary.  When Rob and I met it was like that too - but our intensities matched and only drew us into each other more instead of making the other person \'run\' away.  You know the kind of people that seem to see right through you with their eyes?  Amazing.  The eyes are the true window into the soul.

If you just want the list without my asides, check out the full schedule at <a href=\"http://wordcamp.org\">WordCamp.org</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://phxwordcamp.com/\">WordCamp Phoenix</a> is first up, on November 13. I&#8217;d planned on attending this one myself before they changed the date (it was originally scheduled for the 7th), but will sadly have to miss it as it conflicts with WordCamp NYC. If you, like me, can&#8217;t make it to Phoenix, be sure to check their web site for information on the <a href=\"http://phxwordcamp.com/live-video-stream/\">live stream</a> they&#8217;re planning to provide. If it&#8217;s anywhere near the quality of the stream from Portland or Seattle earlier this fall, it&#8217;ll be just like being there, but without a t-shirt to show for it (and theirs has stripes, so if you&#8217;re local, you should go!). My only consolation in missing this WordCamp is that I&#8217;ve seen about half of the <a href=\"http://phxwordcamp.com/speakers/\">speakers</a> before. If you&#8217;re going, don&#8217;t miss the session by <a href=\"http://johnhawkinsunrated.com\">John Hawkins</a> on <a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2009/09/20/john-hawkins-plugin-building-portland09/\"><em>Building a WordPress Plugin</em></a>; it got me to write my first plugin in Portland! <a href=\"http://ma.tt\">Matt</a>&#8216;ll be there, will you?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wordcampvictoria.ca/agenda/\">WordCamp Victoria</a> is next, on November 14. This is another one I&#8217;d love to go to, but can&#8217;t because it&#8217;s at the same time as New York&#8217;s. I would especially have liked to go because it looks like the <a href=\"http://www.wordcampvictoria.ca/speaker-biographies/\">speakers</a> are all local, and I haven&#8217;t seen any of them speak before. Occasionally WordCamps lose a little of the local feeling by focusing on visiting speakers, so it&#8217;s nice to see so many Vancouverites on the list. They&#8217;ll have a Blogger track and a Technical track running concurrently, so there should a little something for everyone. No word on a live stream, but hopefully they&#8217;ll be able to catch some of the presentations on video and post them to <a href=\"http://WordPress.tv\">WordPress.tv</a> after the event.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wordcamp.kapook.com/en/\">WordCamp Bangkok</a> is scheduled for November 15. I have to admit that the first thing that catches my eye on their agenda is &#8220;WordPress Band.&#8221; I&#8217;ve known WordCamps to have <a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2008/10/31/wordcamp-sf-2008-andy-skelton-deserve/\">people</a> <a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2008/10/31/wordcamp-sf-2008-chuck-lewis-the-seo-rapper/\">performing</a> <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/5354329\">songs</a> before, but a whole band? Might be a first. I hope they&#8217;ll post the video to WordPress.tv, too.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://2009.newyork.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp New York City</a> is the same weekend as the previous three, on November 14-15. In the interest of full disclosure, I need to tell you that I&#8217;m one of the organizers of WordCamp NYC, so my informative comment about it here may be a little biased. <img src=\'http://wordpress.org/development/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\' alt=\':)\' class=\'wp-smiley\' />  That said, we have over <a href=\"http://2009.newyork.wordcamp.org/speakers/\">50 confirmed speakers</a> (both local and visiting), and <a href=\"http://2009.newyork.wordcamp.org/program/\">2 full days of content</a> in 8 &#8212; count &#8216;em, 8 &#8212; tracks. Newbies get a free year of hosting and walked through setting up a WordPress blog in workshop format, while the other tracks have specialized content for Bloggers, CMS Users, Beginning Developers, Advanced Developers, Academic Users, people interested in MU/BuddyPress, and the Open Source Community. Did I mention the <a href=\"http://2009.newyork.wordcamp.org/plugintheme-competition/\">theme and plugin contest</a>? Or the <a href=\"http://2009.newyork.wordcamp.org/2009/10/28/my-favorite-conference-shirt/\">awesome shirts</a>? How about the Genius Bar, or the Hacker Room? The additional Unconference sessions? If you&#8217;re anywhere near NYC that weekend (and with the Acela, that&#8217;s anywhere from Boston to D.C.), you should definitely come. I&#8217;ll be there, Matt&#8217;ll be there, lead developer Mark Jaquith will be there, lead developer of BuddyPress Andy Peatling will be there, and too many other WordPress luminaries and locals to mention. If we hit 800 registrations by November 12, I&#8217;m baking cookies for everyone.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://peru.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Peru</a> will be on November 28 in Lima. I was checking out their topics list, and it looks like they&#8217;re planning to cover all the usual topics around blog administration, security, increasing traffic, and integration with social media sites. No speaker list yet, but if you&#8217;re in Peru, it looks like this will be a nice gathering of WordPress users, and they&#8217;re hoping to have around 100 people attend.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wordcamporlando.org/\">WordCamp Orlando</a> is the last of the year, on December 5. They haven&#8217;t published a speaker list or schedule yet, but I know Matt will be there, Mark Jaquith will be there, and I will be there. I know some other awesome core contributors are planning to come, but I don&#8217;t want to jinx anything, so if you&#8217;re curious, come see for yourself. Plus, Florida in December!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"http://wordpress.org/development/2009/11/upcoming-wordcamps-3/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n		\n		\n			\n			\n		\n		\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:5:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19:\"Upcoming Bug Hunts!\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"http://wordpress.org/development/2009/10/upcoming-bug-hunts/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"http://wordpress.org/development/2009/10/upcoming-bug-hunts/#comments\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 31 Oct 2009 21:28:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:8:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Events\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"testing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"beta\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"bugs\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"sprint\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:6;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"tickets\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:7;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"trac\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"http://wordpress.org/development/?p=953\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:339:\"As we near completion of the 2.9 milestone, it&#8217;s that time of dev cycle again, when we ask all you community developers who&#8217;ve been putting off contributing to core to dust off your dev environments and help us get closer to being release-ready.

How? Bug hunts! Yes, that time-honored tradition (in the time of WordPress, anyway) of everyone pitching in to test patches and report the results, working on solutions to major bugs, and helping to clear out Trac has come around again, and we&#8217;re scheduling not one, but two bug hunts over the next couple of weeks to ensure that everyone has enough time to prepare and <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/\">participate</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>#1</strong> &#8211; The first bug hunt of 2.9 will be Thursday through Saturday, November 5-7, 2009. This should give people a few days to plan for it, upgrade their dev environments if they haven&#8217;t been following trunk, and figure out how to allot their time. We&#8217;re stretching over both weekdays and weekend to try and accommodate everyone&#8217;s schedule.</p>\n<p><strong>#2 </strong>- The second bug hunt will be a week later, Saturday through Monday, November 14-16, 2009. This should make it possible for anyone who needs more than a week to set some time aside to participate. This bug hunt will coincide with <a href=\"http://2009.newyork.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp NYC</a>, where a special Hacker Room will be set aside for people to go and work on 2.9 bug tickets alongside regular core contributors including Mark Jaquith and Matt Martz (sivel from IRC).</p>\n<h4>The Goals</h4>\n<p><strong>Test, test, test existing patches!</strong> You can see all tickets with patches that need testing by checking <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/report/13\">this report</a>. When you&#8217;ve tested a patch, report your results in the ticket comments, so core committers can see how the patch is faring.</p>\n<p><strong>Fix known bugs! </strong>You can see the bugs that need patches by checking <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/report/16\">this report</a>. Look for the ones that seem that they&#8217;ll affect the most people or have the biggest impact by being fixed. Edge case bugs should be lower priority.</p>\n<p><strong>Report new bugs! </strong>As you&#8217;re testing out the development version, if you come across a bug, <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/search\">search trac</a> to see if someone has reported it yet.

We do not recommend running beta versions on your normal, live sites in case anything goes wrong.  You can read more about the plugin in &#8220;<a href=\"http://westi.wordpress.com/2009/06/22/making-it-easy-to-be-a-wordpress-tester/\">Making it easy to be a WordPress Tester</a>&#8221;</p>\n<p>We are aiming to release the first beta version of 2.9 around the end of October, after we have put the finishing touches on the new features. Then we switch to full on beta testing mode and your help and feedback will be very much appreciated.  During the beta test program will push out new builds for automated upgrades regularly. Once we feel that a suitable level of stability has been achieved we will move into the release candidate phase. We hope to be able to make the final release 2.9 build available in either late November or early December.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"http://wordpress.org/development/2009/10/getting-involved-with-the-2-9-beta-testing/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2:\"72\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:44:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n		\n		\n			\n			\n		\n		\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:5:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"How to Keep WordPress Secure\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"http://wordpress.org/development/2009/09/keep-wordpress-secure/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"http://wordpress.org/development/2009/09/keep-wordpress-secure/#comments\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 05 Sep 2009 19:22:03 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Security\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"http://wordpress.org/development/?p=908\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:301:\"A stitch in time saves nine.

This particular worm, like many before it, is clever: it registers a user, uses a security bug (fixed earlier in the year) to allow evaluated code to be executed through the permalink structure, makes itself an admin, then uses JavaScript to hide itself when you look at users page, attempts to clean up after itself, then goes quiet so you never notice while it inserts hidden spam and malware into your old posts.</p>\n<p>The tactics are new, but the strategy is not. Where this particular worm messes up is in the &#8220;clean up&#8221; phase: it doesn&#8217;t hide itself well and the blogger notices that all his links are broken, which causes him to dig deeper and notice the extent of the damage. Where worms of old would do childish things like defacing your site, the new ones are silent and invisible, so you only notice them when they screw up (as this one did) or your site gets removed from Google for having spam and malware on it.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m talking about this not to scare you, but to highlight that this is something that has happened before, and that will more than likely happen again.</p>\n<p>A stitch in time saves nine. <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress\">Upgrading is a known quantity of work</a>, and one that the WordPress community has tried its darndest to make as easy as possible with one-click upgrades. <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ_My_site_was_hacked\">Fixing a hacked blog, on the other hand, is quite hard</a>. Upgrading is taking your vitamins; fixing a hack is open heart surgery. (This is true of cost, as well.)</p>\n<p>2.8.4, the current version of WordPress, is immune to this worm. (<em>So was the release before this one.</em>) If you&#8217;ve been thinking about upgrading but haven&#8217;t gotten around to it yet, now would be a really good time. If you&#8217;ve already upgraded your blogs, maybe check out the blogs of your friends or that you read and see if they need any help. A stitch in time saves nine.</p>\n<p>Whenever a worm makes the rounds, everyone becomes a security expert and peddles one of three types of advice: snake oil, Club solutions, or real solutions. Snake oil you&#8217;ll be able to spot right away because it&#8217;s <em>easy</em>. Hide the WordPress version, they say, and you&#8217;ll be fine. Uh, duh, the worm writers thought of that. Where their 1.0 might have checked for version numbers, 2.0 just tests capabilities, version number be damned. </p>\n<p>The second type of advice is Club solutions; to illustrate, I&#8217;ll quote from <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/10/29/club_vs_lojack_solutions\">Mark Pilgrim&#8217;s excellent essay on spam 7 years ago, before WordPress even existed</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The <em>really</em> interesting thing about these approaches, from a game theory perspective, is that they are all <a href=\"http://slate.msn.com/?id=2041\" title=\"Slate, August 3, 1997: Property Is Theft: When protecting your own property is stealing from others\">Club solutions, not Lojack solutions</a>.  There are two basic approaches to protecting your car from theft: <a href=\"http://www.theclub.com/\">The Club</a> (or The Shield, or a car alarm, or something similar), and <a href=\"http://www.lojack.com/\">Lojack</a>.  The Club isn’t much protection against a thief who is determined to steal <em>your</em> car (it’s easy enough to drill the lock, or just cut the steering wheel and slide The Club off).  But it is effective protection against a thief who wants to steal <em>a</em> car (not necessarily <em>your</em> car), because thieves are generally in a hurry and will go for the easiest target, the low-hanging fruit.  The Club works as long as not everyone has it, since if everyone had it, thieves would have an equally difficult time stealing any car, their choice will be based on other factors, and your car is back to being as vulnerable as anyone else&#8217;s.  The Club doesn’t deter theft, it only deflects it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Club blog security solutions can be simple (like an .htaccess file) or incredibly complex (like two-factor authentication), and they can work, especially for <em>known exploits</em>. Club solutions can be useful, like using a strong or complex password for your login &#8212; no one would recommend against that. (Another club solution is switching to less-used software on the assumption or more like the software&#8217;s claim that it&#8217;s perfect and more secure. This is why BeOS is more secure than Linux, ahem.)</p>\n<p>In the car world, if someone figured out how to teleport entire cars to chop shops, The Club wouldn&#8217;t be so useful anymore. Luckily for manufacturers of The Club, this hasn&#8217;t happened. Online and in the software world, though, the equivalent happens almost daily. There is only one real solution. <strong>The only thing that I can promise will keep your blog secure today and in the future is upgrading.</strong></p>\n<p>WordPress is a community of hundreds of people that read the code every day, audit it, update it, and care enough about keeping your blog safe that we do things like release updates weeks apart from each other even though it makes us look bad, because updating is going to keep your blog safe from the bad guys. I&#8217;m not clairvoyant and I can&#8217;t predict what schemes spammers, hackers, crackers, and tricksters will come up with with in the future to harm your blog, but I do know for certain that as long as WordPress is around we&#8217;ll do everything in our power to make sure the software is safe. We&#8217;ve already made upgrading core and plugins a one-click procedure. If we find something broken, we&#8217;ll release a fix. Please upgrade, it&#8217;s the only way we can help each other.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"http://wordpress.org/development/2009/09/keep-wordpress-secure/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"451\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:44:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n		\n		\n			\n			\n		\n		\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:5:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"WordPress 2.8.4: Security Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"http://wordpress.org/development/2009/08/2-8-4-security-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"http://wordpress.org/development/2009/08/2-8-4-security-release/#comments\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 12 Aug 2009 01:41:54 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Security\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"http://wordpress.org/development/?p=903\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:329:\"Yesterday a vulnerability was discovered: a specially crafted URL could be requested that would allow an attacker to bypass a security check to verify a user requested a password reset.

Back in May of this year, this malicious botnet was responsible for infecting a large number of websites in a short period of time. This time around however, the Gumblar botnet has buggy code which is leading to a number of infected WordPress sites breaking.</p>\n<blockquote><p>WordPress is a complex web application that comprises more than 200 .php files. When you open any page, WordPress loads index.php which, in turn, loads many other .php files using the require() function. WordPress admin interface also relies on multiple .php files. In all cases, WordPress loads wp-config.php file which contains database credentials and other important information required for normal operation.</p>\n<p>So what happens if both index.php and wp-config.php are infected with the gumblar backdoor scripts? Since Gumblar injects identical backdoor scripts into files on the same site, they’ll have declarations of identically named functions, which PHP doesn’t allow. Hence the “cannot redeclare zsmh() …” error.</p></blockquote>\n<p>One thing not mentioned in the Unmasked Parasites post is information regarding which specific versions of WordPress are at risk or are safe to use. I&#8217;ve left a comment on the blog post to try and get an answer but until then, Denis Sinegubko provides <a href=\"http://blog.unmaskparasites.com/2009/10/23/revenge-of-gumblar-zombies/\">detection and removal instructions</a> while also suggesting the use of the <a href=\"http://ocaoimh.ie/exploit-scanner/\">WordPress Exploit Scanner</a> which scans for WordPress files for signs of suspicious activity. </p>\n<p>Based on the reports of infection, this does not appear to be a WordPress centric issue pointing to a problem with the software. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 06 Nov 2009 15:18:01 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"WP iPhone: 20,000 downloads of WordPress for iPhone 2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"http://iphone.wordpress.org/?p=506\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"http://iphone.wordpress.org/2009/11/06/20000-downloads/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5415:\"<div class=\"snap_preview\"><br /><p>It&#8217;s been just over a week since WordPress for iPhone 2 was released on the App Store. In that time, you&#8217;ve downloaded the app onto over 20,000 iPhones and iPods. We&#8217;re really pleased to see how many people are interested in the app, especially those who are able to use it for the first time with version 2.0. To mark the occasion, we wanted to show you our new video introduction for the app, take the time to share some data with you, and answer a few questions we&#8217;ve been seeing.</p>\n<ins>\n<div class=\"video-player\" id=\"x-video-0\">\n</div></ins>\n<p>We&#8217;re also keeping track of downloads by country and by iPhone OS version. This helps us identify the languages to focus on once we begin translating the app, and helps us plan for which new OS features we can count on our users having available.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-540\" title=\"charts\" src=\"http://wpiphone.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/charts1.png?w=571&#038;h=485\" alt=\"charts\" width=\"571\" height=\"485\" /></p>\n<p>As happy as we are with the reception for 2.0, we continue working hard to make it even better. We&#8217;ve identified a few recurring questions that we&#8217;d like to answer for everyone.</p>\n<p><strong>Q. Why is this a new app? I don&#8217;t want to re-enter my blog settings.</strong><br />\nA. Previous versions of WordPress for iPhone were uploaded to the App Store by a contracted developer. To make it easier for us to test new features, fix bugs, and update the app more often, that task will now be handled by those of us developing the app at Automattic. Apple’s only method for changing the “ownership” of an app in the store is to release a completely new version, as we&#8217;ve done here. It&#8217;s a bit painful, we know, but we should be set now for all future releases.</p>\n<p><strong>Q. Why did you remove landscape mode?<br />\n</strong>A. It&#8217;s still there. Bring up the on-screen keyboard to start editing a post, then rotate the device. Apple doesn&#8217;t support landscape mode in some areas, particularly the photo picker and the date selection wheel. Having landscape mode turned on for every section was causing bugs that were impossible to fix (while still using Apple&#8217;s standard user interface elements).  So we&#8217;ve removed it from the areas of the app where it didn&#8217;t work well, and kept it in the writing interface, where it&#8217;s really useful.</p>\n<p><strong>Q. I can&#8217;t log in!<br />\n</strong>A. Ok, not quite a question, but we&#8217;ve seen this one a few times on iTunes. However, we haven&#8217;t yet had a report of this in the <a href=\"http://iphone.forums.wordpress.org\">forums</a>, the only place we&#8217;re able to provide hands-on assistance with the app. If you&#8217;re sure that you&#8217;re entering your URL, username, and password correctly and are still unable to connect, please let us know in the forums. (A quick hint for connection issues: Make sure you&#8217;re using the latest version of WordPress, 2.8.5, and try temporarily disabling any plugins you have installed). We&#8217;ve done lots of work in version 2.0 to eliminate connection problems for the vast majority of blog setups. We&#8217;d like to make it work for everyone, but can only help when you work with us to troubleshoot the problem you&#8217;re having.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve already begun working on issues identified since the release of 2.0, and are looking forward to being able to provide more timely updates for you going forward.

Or, plugins for WordPress that will allow you to provide various files to your website visitors for download. Over the years I&#8217;ve gone through many. Everyone will have a different preference but, here is a list of my top plugins for managing downloads with WordPress&#8230;</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/drain-hole/\">Drain Hole</a></strong><br />\nI&#8217;ve been using Drain Hole on <a href=\"http://www.jamesdimick.com/\">my personal site</a> to serve up my files for a couple years now. So far it is the best download manager plugin I&#8217;ve been able to find. It does everything it advertises and does it well. I&#8217;ve not yet had any issues with this plugin. I highly recommend it!</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-downloadmanager/\">WP-DownloadManager</a></strong><br />\nBefore I found Drain Hole I used WP-DownloadManager exclusively. It did what I wanted and didn&#8217;t seem to have many problems. It has the features most would expect in such a plugin. It also has some you might not. Such things as custom templates, categories, RSS feeds, and more.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-filebase/\">WP-Filebase</a></strong><br />\nI actually just recently learned of WP-Filebase. I can&#8217;t speak from personal experience but from the research I&#8217;ve done on it I think it would be one of the best options. It has the obvious features you expect from a download manager. Some of the highlights are quick tags, top downloads widget, extensive file details, and even download pausing.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/download-monitor/\">Wordpress Download Monitor</a></strong><br />\nI really like the interface of Wordpress Download Monitor. It&#8217;s simple yet complete. It does its job as a download manager and keeps it simple at the same time. Some of the attraction points of this plugin are: simple custom download URLs, custom error pages, download mirrors, and even custom fields for all files.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simple-download-monitor/\">Simple Download Monitor</a></strong><br />\nWhat&#8217;s great about Simple Download Monitor is right in its name. It&#8217;s simple! To quote the author of the plugin &#8220;<em>&#8230;I wanted to monitor the number of downloads of my files without having to maintain any kind of database or making any special download links. I just wanted to upload a file to a designated directory using FTP, provide a direct link to it and once in a while check the number of downloads</em>&#8220;. This plugin also allows advanced logging.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What I think is especially nice is that all these plugins seem to be compatible with the upcoming WordPress 2.9. That means that they are future-proof for at least the foreseeable future. I took time to test each one of these plugins during the writing of this post. But, feel free to let me know if you have experienced anything to the contrary with any of them.</p>\n<p>Well, that&#8217;s all for now. I hope you enjoyed the post and I hope you might be able to get something useful out of this list.</p>\n<p>Do you have a good idea for the next article in the Best-Of series?

If you just want the list without my asides, check out the full schedule at <a href=\"http://wordcamp.org\">WordCamp.org</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://phxwordcamp.com/\">WordCamp Phoenix</a> is first up, on November 13. I&#8217;d planned on attending this one myself before they changed the date (it was originally scheduled for the 7th), but will sadly have to miss it as it conflicts with WordCamp NYC. If you, like me, can&#8217;t make it to Phoenix, be sure to check their web site for information on the <a href=\"http://phxwordcamp.com/live-video-stream/\">live stream</a> they&#8217;re planning to provide. If it&#8217;s anywhere near the quality of the stream from Portland or Seattle earlier this fall, it&#8217;ll be just like being there, but without a t-shirt to show for it (and theirs has stripes, so if you&#8217;re local, you should go!). My only consolation in missing this WordCamp is that I&#8217;ve seen about half of the <a href=\"http://phxwordcamp.com/speakers/\">speakers</a> before. If you&#8217;re going, don&#8217;t miss the session by <a href=\"http://johnhawkinsunrated.com\">John Hawkins</a> on <a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2009/09/20/john-hawkins-plugin-building-portland09/\"><em>Building a WordPress Plugin</em></a>; it got me to write my first plugin in Portland! <a href=\"http://ma.tt\">Matt</a>&#8216;ll be there, will you?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wordcampvictoria.ca/agenda/\">WordCamp Victoria</a> is next, on November 14. This is another one I&#8217;d love to go to, but can&#8217;t because it&#8217;s at the same time as New York&#8217;s. I would especially have liked to go because it looks like the <a href=\"http://www.wordcampvictoria.ca/speaker-biographies/\">speakers</a> are all local, and I haven&#8217;t seen any of them speak before. Occasionally WordCamps lose a little of the local feeling by focusing on visiting speakers, so it&#8217;s nice to see so many Vancouverites on the list. They&#8217;ll have a Blogger track and a Technical track running concurrently, so there should a little something for everyone. No word on a live stream, but hopefully they&#8217;ll be able to catch some of the presentations on video and post them to <a href=\"http://WordPress.tv\">WordPress.tv</a> after the event.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wordcamp.kapook.com/en/\">WordCamp Bangkok</a> is scheduled for November 15. I have to admit that the first thing that catches my eye on their agenda is &#8220;WordPress Band.&#8221; I&#8217;ve known WordCamps to have <a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2008/10/31/wordcamp-sf-2008-andy-skelton-deserve/\">people</a> <a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2008/10/31/wordcamp-sf-2008-chuck-lewis-the-seo-rapper/\">performing</a> <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/5354329\">songs</a> before, but a whole band? Might be a first. I hope they&#8217;ll post the video to WordPress.tv, too.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://2009.newyork.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp New York City</a> is the same weekend as the previous three, on November 14-15. In the interest of full disclosure, I need to tell you that I&#8217;m one of the organizers of WordCamp NYC, so my informative comment about it here may be a little biased. <img src=\"http://wordpress.org/development/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />  That said, we have over <a href=\"http://2009.newyork.wordcamp.org/speakers/\">50 confirmed speakers</a> (both local and visiting), and <a href=\"http://2009.newyork.wordcamp.org/program/\">2 full days of content</a> in 8 &#8212; count &#8216;em, 8 &#8212; tracks. Newbies get a free year of hosting and walked through setting up a WordPress blog in workshop format, while the other tracks have specialized content for Bloggers, CMS Users, Beginning Developers, Advanced Developers, Academic Users, people interested in MU/BuddyPress, and the Open Source Community. Did I mention the <a href=\"http://2009.newyork.wordcamp.org/plugintheme-competition/\">theme and plugin contest</a>? Or the <a href=\"http://2009.newyork.wordcamp.org/2009/10/28/my-favorite-conference-shirt/\">awesome shirts</a>? How about the Genius Bar, or the Hacker Room? The additional Unconference sessions? If you&#8217;re anywhere near NYC that weekend (and with the Acela, that&#8217;s anywhere from Boston to D.C.), you should definitely come. I&#8217;ll be there, Matt&#8217;ll be there, lead developer Mark Jaquith will be there, lead developer of BuddyPress Andy Peatling will be there, and too many other WordPress luminaries and locals to mention. If we hit 800 registrations by November 12, I&#8217;m baking cookies for everyone.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://peru.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Peru</a> will be on November 28 in Lima. I was checking out their topics list, and it looks like they&#8217;re planning to cover all the usual topics around blog administration, security, increasing traffic, and integration with social media sites. No speaker list yet, but if you&#8217;re in Peru, it looks like this will be a nice gathering of WordPress users, and they&#8217;re hoping to have around 100 people attend.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wordcamporlando.org/\">WordCamp Orlando</a> is the last of the year, on December 5. They haven&#8217;t published a speaker list or schedule yet, but I know Matt will be there, Mark Jaquith will be there, and I will be there. I know some other awesome core contributors are planning to come, but I don&#8217;t want to jinx anything, so if you&#8217;re curious, come see for yourself. Plus, Florida in December!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 06 Nov 2009 02:42:53 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Jane Wells\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"Weblog Tools Collection: WordPress 2.9 Revamps Hello World\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/?p=7046\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2009/11/05/wordpress-2-9-revamps-hello-world/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2968:\"<p>During the WordPress development chat today, one of the topics of discussion centered around the suggestion of changing the Hello World post that is seen with every new install of WordPress to something that contained useful WordPress specific information such as links to the release mailing list, the codex and other helpful material. I&#8217;d like to break down how this change came about to show how easy it is to contribute to the WordPress project without writing a line of code.</p>\n<p>It first started out as a discussion on the WordPress Hackers mailing list concerning the addition of email notifications to the core of WordPress to keep administrators abreast of new versions of WordPress as they were released. The discussion became long winded but <a href=\"http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2009-October/028015.html\" target=\"_blank\">a response</a> by Lynne Pope provided one of those <i>why didn&#8217;t I think of that</i> moments. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Change the sample data &#8211; instead of, &#8220;this is a post&#8221;, provide some meaningful information. With a link to subscribe to WP-Announce. Make an entry announcing that WP-Announce is being used, so this will show in the dashboard feeds. Bloggers will quickly pick up on this and news of it will spread.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Needless to say, her idea sparked a series of kudos with other suggestions for what to include in the sample data. Then, in a WordPress development chat regarding the topic that was discussed on the hackers mailing list, it was agreed that the best course of action would be to not only revive the WP-Announcements mailing list, but to also change the Hello World! post in WordPress to something more useful. A fellow by the name of <a href=\"http://op111.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Demetris</a> took it upon himself to create a draft of what the sample data should be. The discussion surrounding the change including links to see drafts and revisions were included in <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11008\" target=\"_blank\">ticket number 11008</a>. The ticket has been open for two weeks and in <a href=\"https://irclogs.wordpress.org/chanlog.php?channel=wordpress-dev&#038;day=2009-11-05&#038;sort=desc#m35813\" target=\"_blank\">today&#8217;s developer chat</a>, Demetris published a link to his draft which you can <a href=\"http://op111.etherpad.com/3\" target=\"_blank\">view here</a>. There was a unanimous decision to include the sample post data into the core of WordPress starting with version 2.9. If the sample data needs editing, it will be done throughout the beta process before the stable release. </p>\n<p>There you have it. A time line of events that happened in quick succession which provided a small change with huge benefits without having one line of code written. Let me know your thoughts in the comments with regards to the new sample data that will be provided in any new installation of WordPress starting with 2.9. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 06 Nov 2009 00:47:02 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"Weblog Tools Collection: WordPress Plugin Releases for 11/05\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/?p=7024\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2009/11/05/wordpress-plugin-releases-for-1105-2/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4513:\"<h3>New Plugins</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.viper007bond.com/wordpress-plugins/localtime/\">Local Time</a></p>\n<p>Using JavaScript, Local Time automatically transforms all dates and times on your blog into the visitor’s timezone.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://fytch.com/tools/wordpress\">Fytch Comments</a></p>\n<p>Fytch is a fully featured plugin that provides comment publishing to <a href=\"http://fytch.com\">http://fytch.com</a> It allows to assign a Fytch topic to each post so that wordpress comments are co-published under the appropriate topic on <a href=\"http://fytch.com.\">http://fytch.com.</a> It not only allows to publish comments to <a href=\"http://fytch.com\">http://fytch.com</a> but to Twitter and FriendFeed as well.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/vlam-a-post/\">vlam-a-post</a></p>\n<p>vlam-a-post automatically creates a vl.am URL for every post you publish and keeps track of the number of clicks the vl.am URL received.

This should give people a few days to plan for it, upgrade their dev environments if they haven&#8217;t been following trunk, and figure out how to allot their time. We&#8217;re stretching over both weekdays and weekend to try and accommodate everyone&#8217;s schedule.</p>\n<p><strong>#2 </strong>- The second bug hunt will be a week later, Saturday through Monday, November 14-16, 2009. This should make it possible for anyone who needs more than a week to set some time aside to participate. This bug hunt will coincide with <a href=\"http://2009.newyork.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp NYC</a>, where a special Hacker Room will be set aside for people to go and work on 2.9 bug tickets alongside regular core contributors including Mark Jaquith and Matt Martz (sivel from IRC).</p>\n<h4>The Goals</h4>\n<p><strong>Test, test, test existing patches!</strong> You can see all tickets with patches that need testing by checking <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/report/13\">this report</a>. When you&#8217;ve tested a patch, report your results in the ticket comments, so core committers can see how the patch is faring.</p>\n<p><strong>Fix known bugs! </strong>You can see the bugs that need patches by checking <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/report/16\">this report</a>. Look for the ones that seem that they&#8217;ll affect the most people or have the biggest impact by being fixed. Edge case bugs should be lower priority.</p>\n<p><strong>Report new bugs! </strong>As you&#8217;re testing out the development version, if you come across a bug, <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/search\">search trac</a> to see if someone has reported it yet. If so, add a comment with your experience to the ticket so we&#8217;ll know it&#8217;s affecting more than one person. If no ticket exists yet, <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/newticket\">create one</a>.</p>\n<p>Core committers will be around (in the #wordpress-dev channel at irc.freenode.com) both weekends to review patches that have been thoroughly tested, answer questions as needed, and give feedback on patches that need more work before being commit-worthy.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve never participated in a WordPress bug hunt before, but you&#8217;d like to get involved, we&#8217;d love to have you join us!

In my opinion, the WordPress community is like peanut butter, spread across the web really thin. You have to be subscribed to a bunch of different blogs throughout the community in order to get a grasp as to what is happening with the WordPress project. Other than enthusiast sites, you have to know which mailing lists to subscribe to, the developments prologue site, attend the developer chats, and occasionally read a WordPress centric blog post or two from one of the core developers in order to figure out what is going on. I don&#8217;t like this situation. Instead, I would love to see a community portal developed on the WordPress.org site that contains the tools necessary to create a collaboration hub.</p>\n<p>I hesitate to mention another project on a WordPress focused site but I believe there are lessons that can be learned from how Joomla has handled this situation. Joomla has a site called <a href=\"http://community.joomla.org/\">http://community.joomla.org/</a>. The front page of this site acts as a portal to vital aspects of the project including team member blogs, events, featured articles, translations, etc. It&#8217;s as if everything I would need to know or have quick access to is right on the front page housed within this portal.</p>\n<p>On the WordPress side of things, you have to dive into the documentation to find the Codex article that discusses WordPress in your language. The site contains one blog, the development blog for announcements specifically dealing with the software. It&#8217;s not like the good old days when multiple posts per month covering all aspects of the project would be published here. Now you&#8217;re lucky to see two posts or more a month on it. Each WordPress team member has their own blog, most with a WordPress category that is tied into a separate entity called the WordPress Planet that is accessed in the dashboard called Other WordPress News. Not only are the team members added to this site, but so are a number of other projects/sites that are not strictly WordPress related. I realize the team members are busy and some of them contribute to the WordPress project not employed by Automattic but I would like to see more posts published by them focused on the WordPress project. For example, I attend some of the developer chats and I see requests for unit tests or explanations as to how tickets in Trac should be treated yet I don&#8217;t see consistent information published to the public explaining this. Sure, the end user facing crowd has no interest in this, but there are a ton of plugin and theme authors as well as enthusiasts who would be. To be frank, I think that if it were not for websites such as Weblogtoolscollection.com and a host of other WordPress centric community sites, a majority of us would have no clue as to the progress of WordPress except for when a release was imminent. </p>\n<p>I would love to see is a complete redesign of WordPress.org which served as a portal. A portal that could be visited daily to see posts from team members regarding the project, latest posts in the WordPress forum, upcoming WordCamps, a featured WordPress.TV Video, links to some of the most important pages in the Codex, the 3 or 5 newest themes and plugins added to the repository, etc. This post may be premature though as the best thing that could happen to the site is the redesign, plus the ability to use BuddyPress as a means of creating the collaboration hub of it all. I know the BuddyPress situation is currently being worked on and may end up being a reality some day on WordPress.org but for everything else, there is certainly room for improvement across the board.</p>\n<h2>What Say you?</h2>\n<p>First off, what do you think of the current way WordPress.org the project along with the website is laid out? If you had the opportunity, how would you completely restructure the website and team members to turn the site into a collaboration/information hub all about WordPress?</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 30 Oct 2009 22:18:37 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"Weblog Tools Collection: WordPress Theme Releases for 10/30\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/?p=6966\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2009/10/30/wordpress-theme-releases-for-1030/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2297:\"<h4><a href=\"http://3oneseven.com/02/ines/\">Ines BuddyPress</a></h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://wp2.3oneseven.com/index.php?wptheme=Ines\"><img title=\"ines BuddyPress\" src=\"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/inesBuddyPress.png\" alt=\"ines BuddyPress\" width=\"200\" height=\"179\" /></a></p>\n<p>The Ines BuddyPress WP theme, edgy styles for a BuddyPress powered site with the brandnew Ines BuddyPress Theme, featuring a three column fluid layout, enabled with options panel, widgetized sidebars and footers, flickr support, pagenavi support, frontpage slider, orelated posts and recent comments are built into the theme.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"http://dpxmag.com/cleanpress-a-free-premium-wordpress-theme.html\">cleanPRESS</a></h4>\n<p><img title=\"cleanpress\" src=\"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/cleanpress.png\" alt=\"cleanpress\" width=\"200\" height=\"102\" /></p>\n<p>Two column, feature rich theme with support for featured articles, post options and twitter options</p>\n<h4><a href=\"http://www.clubwordpress.com/bare-minimum-wordpress-theme/\">Bare Minimum</a></h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.demo.clubwordpress.com/index.php?wptheme=Bare+Minimum\"><img title=\"Bare Minimum\" src=\"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/BareMinimum.png\" alt=\"Bare Minimum\" width=\"200\" height=\"134\" /></a></p>\n<p>This theme uses the bare minimum files that are needed for a WordPress theme – The theme uses no CSS and contains everything needed to run the theme in index.php.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"http://www.wpskinner.com/2009/10/26/moi-magazine-free-wordpress-theme-release/\">Moi Magazine</a></h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://wpcodex.com/demo/?themedemo=moi-magazine\"><img title=\"Moi Magazine\" src=\"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/MoiMagazine.jpg\" alt=\"Moi Magazine\" width=\"174\" height=\"200\" /></a></p>\n<p>Moi Magazine is a free 2 column magazine style WordPress Theme.

<a href=\"http://wpengineer.com/batch-plugin-update-in-wordpress-2-9/\" target=\"_blank\">mentioned by WP Engineer</a>, WordPress 2.9 recently had a new feature added to it called bulk plugin upgrades. The interesting thing about this feature is back on September 11th, Matt <a href=\"http://twitter.com/photomatt/status/3922695818\" target=\"_blank\">published this</a> through his Twitter feed:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Just upgraded three plugins in about 30 seconds using one-click upgrade &#8212; wish you could do them all at once though.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Well, now you can. I attended the WordPress developers chat today and according to the devs, the bulk upgrader works, all it needs now is to be tied into the API along with some cosmetics. I&#8217;m sure there are plenty of you, including myself that is pleased to see this addition to WordPress. However, I wonder what happens if during a bulk upgrade, one of the plugins fails. Does the upgrader skip the plugin and move on to the next one or does it ruin the entire upgrade? Looking forward to the answer in the comments. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 29 Oct 2009 22:49:40 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"Weblog Tools Collection: WordPress for iPhone 2 Now Available in App Store\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:103:\"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2009/10/29/wordpress-for-iphone-2-now-available-in-app-store/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:103:\"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2009/10/29/wordpress-for-iphone-2-now-available-in-app-store/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1749:\"<p>WordPress 2 for iPhone is now <a href=\"http://iphone.wordpress.org/2009/10/28/wordpress-2-available/\" target=\"_blank\">available for downloads</a> in the App Store.

The biggest change  is adding support for the <a href=\"http://rsscloud.org/walkthrough/openDiscussion.html\">domain parameter</a> in notification requests.  This means that rssCloud updates processed by the plugin are no longer limited to being sent to the IP address that the request came from.  Support for the domain parameter is live on <a href=\"http://wordpress.com/\">WordPress.com</a> as well.</p>\n<p>When a domain parameter is included with a notification request the verification process does the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sends an HTTP GET request to the {domain}:{port}{path} URL</li>\n<li>That HTTP GET includes to pieces of data: url and challenge.  The url field contains the URL of the feed that we&#8217;ll been sending pings about.  The challenge field contains a random string of characters</li>\n<li>The response back must have a status code of 2xx and the body must contain EXACTLY the contents of the challenge field.  If both of those conditions are not met then the verification process will consider this a failure</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For notification requests that have no domain parameter the verification process is unchanged from before.</p>\n<p>Another item that some may find helpful is a new constant &#8211; RSSCLOUD_FEED_URL &#8211; if that is defined they it will be used as the feed URL of the blog instead of determining it via <code>get_bloginfo( \'rss2_url\' );</code>.  For plugin authors that provide options for an alternative feed URL note that can override the default in WordPress via the <code><a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference#Link_Filters\">feed_link</a></code> filter.  That filter can be used instead of the RSSCLOUD_FEED_URL constant and will bubble up through the <code>get_bloginfo( \'rss2_url\' );</code> call.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 29 Oct 2009 17:31:12 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"Joseph Scott\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"BuddyPress: BuddyPress at WordCamp New York\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://buddypress.org/?p=677\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"http://buddypress.org/blog/news/buddypress-at-wordcamp-new-york/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3124:\"<p><a href=\"http://2009.newyork.wordcamp.org\" title=\"WordCampNYC – Nov 14-15\"><img alt=\"WordCampNYC – Nov 14-15\" src=\"http://2009.newyork.wordcamp.org/files/2009/10/wcnyc-wish-125.jpg\" /></a>This year at <a href=\"http://2009.newyork.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp New York</a> there will be a whole track dedicated to WordPress MU and BuddyPress. Some of the topics being presented are:</p>\n<p><strong>Getting off the Farm:</strong><br />WPMU Beyond Blog Hosting. We all know that WPMU can be used to host multiple blogs for public or internal signups. But what else can you do? How far can you stretch it? I’ll be showcasing a number of sites that use WPMU in interesting ways. Speaker: Andrea Rennick.</p>\n<p><strong>Writing Plugins for WordPress/MU:</strong><br />This session will be directed toward plugin developers. We will discuss platform differences &#038; guidelines to keep in mind when writing a plugin for both WordPress &#038; WordPress MU. Speaker: Ron Rennick.</p>\n<p><strong>User Authentication with MU in Existing Ecosystems.</strong><br />Speaker: Casey Bisson.</p>\n<p><strong>How-to with MU: Using Multiple Domains, and Building a Member Directory.</strong><br />A two-part session where we will dig in to two different concepts. First up, we’ll cover how to domain map member blogs, and the difference between multiple sites and multiple domains. The second half will cover how we built a business/member directory and what plugins we used to accomplish this so you can build one too. Speaker: Andrea Rennick.</p>\n<p><strong>Growing Community with BuddyPress:</strong><br />Speaker: Lisa Sabin-Wilson.</p>\n<p><strong>Creating Killer Group Extensions in BuddyPress:</strong><br />In this session learn how to build highly custom feature extensions to BuddyPress groups. Andy will be talking through how you can use the new group extension API to build Twitter stream integration right into your groups. Speaker: Andy Peatling.</p>\n<p><strong>Developing BuddyPress as a Collaboration Hub:</strong><br />In this presentation, I’ll discuss some of the BuddyPress development I’ve done to bridge the WordPress/bbPress/MediaWiki platforms, taking BP beyond its roots as a social networking platform and turning it into a collaboration hub: a space where users can find, friend, and team up with each other (the social networking part BP that does well), work together to produce content (that’s the “collaboration” part), and feed the content back into BP (that’s the “hub” part). Speaker: Boone Gorges.</p>\n<p>Other soon-to-be confirmed sessions: Setting up BuddyPress (workshop); BuddyPress theme framework.</p>\n<p>For a full list of sessions please see the <a href=\"http://2009.newyork.wordcamp.org/program\">program page</a>.</p>\n<p>It should be a fantastic event with space for up to 1000 people.

Woohoo!</p>\n<p><strong>A quick note about installation:</strong> WordPress for iPhone 2 is a new app, and the previous version won&#8217;t automatically update to 2.0.  Installing it won&#8217;t overwrite any previous version you have installed. When you launch the new app, you&#8217;ll immediately see &#8220;Version 2.0&#8243; at the bottom of the screen. When you&#8217;re no longer using it, you can safely remove the previous version from your device.</p>\n<p>Our efforts were focused on creating a better user experience &#8212; the beginnings of a user interface overhaul that we&#8217;ll continue with the next version, and eliminating the bugs and incompatibilities with some self-hosted WordPress setups that was the source of the majority of the support requests we see in the <a href=\"http://iphone.forums.wordpress.org\">forum</a>.</p>\n<p>So, what&#8217;s new in version 2?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A new, more efficient user interface that makes it faster to switch between comments, posts, and pages.</li>\n<li>Various user interface refinements and bug fixes</li>\n<li>New Comments interface, with Gravatars and the author URL shown in the comment list</li>\n<li>Passwords are now stored in the keychain</li>\n<li>Posts are now automatically saved and restored if network connection is lost during publishing</li>\n<li>Added persistence, so the app re-opens in the blog you last used</li>\n<li>Added an interface for manually entering the XMLRPC endpoint for non-standard setups</li>\n<li>Fixed rotation-related visual glitches</li>\n<li>Fixed errors where malformed XML prevented access to XMLRPC endpoint</li>\n<li>Fixed edge case where local drafts were sometimes not saved</li>\n<li>Fixed the order of photos so that they&#8217;re displayed in the order they&#8217;re uploaded</li>\n</ul>\n<p>WordPress for iPhone, just like WordPress itself, is an Open Source app. Our source code is publicly available, and anyone can contribute to it. On behalf of all the developers, thank you to everyone who wrote code, submitted their ideas or bug reports, built and tested new features with the iPhone Simulator, and installed our beta releases. They helped bring you this app, and we&#8217;re excited to have you all start using it!</p>\n<p>Just a reminder: we&#8217;ve started a new blog called <a href=\"http://iphonedev.wordpress.org\">Making WordPress for iPhone</a>, where we&#8217;ll talk about the features we&#8217;re tackling for the next version of the app, and keep you up to date on our progress.

We&#8217;re getting closer and closer to my overall vision for the service.</p>\n<p class=\"center\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/alexkingorg/4053548762/\" title=\"New Home Page by alexkingorg, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2777/4053548762_a779bb6442_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"234\" alt=\"New Home Page\" /></a></p>\n<h3>Affiliate Program</h3>\n<p>The affiliate program is really core to how we want the HelpCenter to work (note: anyone can join the affiliate program). It creates a formal relationship between WPHC and plugin and theme authors so that we can support the great WordPress development community. It sets up:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>WPHC to pay plugin and theme authors when we do paid work with plugins or themes they created.</li>\n<li>Makes it easy for plugin and theme authors give us FAQs and tips about the things they have built so that we can provide great support for them.</li>\n<li>Builds relationships with plugin and theme authors so we can send them bug reports and contact them with advanced issues we are dealing with.</li>\n<li>Rewards affiliates for referring business to us.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"center\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/alexkingorg/4053557146/\" title=\"Affiliate Account by alexkingorg, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2485/4053557146_5e5b2568e6_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"233\" alt=\"Affiliate Account\" /></a></p>\n<p>We have a collection of badges that plugin and theme authors can place on their web sites and in the WordPress admin pages for their plugins and themes to direct people to the WordPress HelpCenter to get support (and earn affiliate payments).</p>\n<p class=\"center\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/alexkingorg/4052816919/\" title=\"WordPress Admin Badge by alexkingorg, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2555/4052816919_8914fa1016_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"232\" alt=\"WordPress Admin Badge\" /></a></p>\n<p>We also have released a <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wphelpcenter/\" rel=\"external\">WordPress plugin</a> that does two things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>it adds a WordPress HelpCenter support tab to the admin interface to make it easy for people to contact WPHC for support.</li>\n<li>It creates a system profile that details key information about a WordPress installation that is very useful in troubleshooting and debugging. This system profile can be sent to WordPress HelpCenter.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Affiliates can download a customized version of this plugin that includes their affiliate code so that they receive a referral payment in addition to any payments for work we do with plugins and themes they have registered with us.</p>\n<p class=\"center\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/alexkingorg/4053576486/\" title=\"HelpCenter tab by alexkingorg, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2689/4053576486_59490be96b_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"111\" alt=\"HelpCenter tab\" /></a></p>\n<p>We think that this may be something that plugin and theme authors may want to distribute along with their work. Additionally, developers that create WordPress powered sites but may not be in position to provide on-call support for them may want to install this on sites they create for their clients.</p>\n<p>The system profile page created by the plugin uses standard WordPress filters to enable plugin and theme authors to add information to it that may be relevant for their plugins or themes.</p>\n<p class=\"center\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/alexkingorg/4052835889/\" title=\"System Profile by alexkingorg, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2743/4052835889_c148d49133_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"104\" alt=\"System Profile\" /></a></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m really excited about the affiliate program because it provides a monetary reward for plugin and theme developers while actually removing a burden from them and potentially freeing them up to spend more time building great things for the WordPress community.</p>\n<p>Over the years I&#8217;ve thought and brainstormed quite a bit about ways to provide financial incentives for WordPress developers. Our affiliate program is a start. It&#8217;s a true win-win arrangement, and it will only get better as the WordPress community continues to grow.</p>\n<h3>Public Knowledge Base</h3>\n<p class=\"center\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/alexkingorg/4053576418/\" title=\"Public Knowledge Base by alexkingorg, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3533/4053576418_802e93bbec_m.jpg\" width=\"239\" height=\"240\" alt=\"Public Knowledge Base\" /></a></p>\n<p>The public knowledge base is another core element to WPHC and our vision of what we want it to be. We do troubleshooting and debugging of WordPress, plugin and theme issues every day, and this gives us a way to share the solutions we find with the community.</p>\n<p>In addition to our own notes, when affiliates register plugins and themes with us they have the opportunity to add FAQs and tips about those plugins and themes. As appropriate, we then make that information publicly available.</p>\n<p>Even better, the affiliates can come back and add additional FAQs and tips at any time. This is something I&#8217;m really excited about because the way that plugin README files work, they always lag one release behind on wordpress.org.</p>\n<p>We have a section on the site for <a href=\"http://wphelpcenter.com/plugins/\">plugins</a> and for <a href=\"http://wphelpcenter.com/themes/\">themes</a>. There are a few resources up there now, I&#8217;m looking forward to watching these areas grow in the future as more affiliates sign up and register their plugins and themes with us.</p>\n<p>I expect this to become a very useful resource for the WordPress community; one that grows nicely over time.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I view the WPHC from several different perspectives.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As the founder and a partner in the business, I want it to be financially viable so that we can maintain a great staff and provide top notch service.</li>\n<li>As a WordPress professional, I need it to be a place I trust and feel comfortable referring my clients to for support.</li>\n<li>As a WordPress developer, I want users of my plugins and themes to be able to get great support. I also know that with the growth of the WordPress community and the responsibilities I currently enjoy, I am no longer in a position to provide that support directly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From all of these perspectives, it is of paramount importance to me that the WordPress HelpCenter be a shining and trusted member of the WordPress community. The team and I are very committed to making that happen.</p>\n<p>If we are able to continue to build it as we envision, the WordPress HelpCenter will be a great asset to the entire WordPress community. With these new features, I believe we&#8217;ve taken a few big steps in that direction.</p>\n<img src=\"http://alexking.org/wp/?ak_action=api_record_view&id=3703&type=feed\" alt=\"\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 28 Oct 2009 17:34:33 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Alex\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"Dev Blog: Plugin Compatibility Beta\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"http://wordpress.org/development/?p=944\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"http://wordpress.org/development/2009/10/plugin-compatibility-beta/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3192:\"<p>The number one reason people give us for not upgrading to the latest version of WordPress is fear that their plugins won&#8217;t be compatible. As part of our continuing efforts to make WordPress core, plugin, and theme upgrades as painless as possible, Michael Adams developed and launched a beta of a new &#8220;Compatibility&#8221; feature in the plugin directory, powered by your votes. When viewing a plugin in the directory, select a WordPress version and a plugin version from the drop-downs. If there has been feedback about this WordPress / plugin version combination, we&#8217;ll show you what percentage of responses marked that combination as compatible vs how many marked it as incompatible.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/files/2009/10/compatibility-viewing.png\" alt=\"Compatibility: Your Setup: (WordPress Version drop-down) (Plugin Version drop-down).

Just select a WordPress version / plugin version combination and click the &#8220;Works&#8221; or the &#8220;Broken&#8221; button. Please note that this shouldn&#8217;t be used to report minor issues with a plugin. You should mark a plugin as &#8220;Broken&#8221; only if its core functionality is truly broken when run on the specified WordPress version.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/files/2009/10/compatibility-voting.png\" alt=\"Compatibility: Your Setup: (WordPress Version drop-down) (Plugin Version drop-down).

The <code>plugin_information</code> action now returns a &#8220;compatibility&#8221; member with the multidimensional array format:</p>\n<p><code>array( {WP version} => array( {plugin version} => array( {% of reporters who say it works}, {# responses} ) ) )</code></p>\n<p>If the API knows which version of WordPress you are using (for example, if you are making this query using the <code>plugins_api()</code> function from with WordPress), the API will only return compatibility information for your version of WordPress.</p>\n<p>Eventually, we&#8217;d like to gather this compatibility feedback from within WordPress, allowing you to vote directly from your plugins admin screen. The ultimate goal is to use this information to inform you of plugin incompatibilities with a new version of WordPress during the upgrade process.

The post highlights the fact that bbPress is not going away and that it is an important project for the WordPress community. After all, it powers the WordPress.org plugin repository, the support forums, and <a href=\"http://www.talkpress.com\" target=\"_blank\">TalkPress</a>, Automattics hosted forum service.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Strategically the most important thing we need to figure out is how to integrate bbPress better with WP more for people who want that &#8212; right now it&#8217;s easier to use one of the WP plugins for forums than bbPress.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I&#8217;ve only installed bbPress locally once to check it out but it&#8217;s not my cup of tea. I think the bbPress forum software is aimed at developers since it comes with all the basics to build on or around but doesn&#8217;t contain the feature set of modern forum software out of the box. For example, the <a href=\"http://simplepressforum.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SimplePress</a> plugin for WordPress Matt mentions is packed with more features than the dedicated forum software. One idea I&#8217;ve heard Matt discuss with Sam that I think has a ton of potential is to replace or add onto the WordPress comment system with bbPress. This type of tight integration between the two is what I believe Matt wants to figure out. It would be awesome to have such an easy way to not only have a forum where visitors can start their own conversations, but also leave comments on articles on the blog side of things. I hesitate to mention Vbulletin but it&#8217;s the software that comes to mind that takes this to the next level by offering their own CMS with the forum software built into it. </p>\n<p>One of the best things bbPress has going for it right now is the work of Andy Peatling. In <a href=\"http://buddypress.org/blog/news/buddypress-1-1-released/\" target=\"_blank\">BuddyPress 1.1</a> Andy rewrote the forums component from the ground up to provide one click internal bbPress forum integration enabling users to setup forums in a fraction of the time. BuddyPress is gaining traction and as Matt says, has all the ingredients to become as large and successful as WordPress. I think the more people that use BuddyPress, the more that will use bbPress building that community simultaneously with BuddyPress. </p>\n<h2>Your Thoughts:</h2>\n<p>You tell me, or Matt. What is the future of bbPress you would like to see turn into a reality? Also, if you use bbPress, tell me why and how.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 28 Oct 2009 11:46:47

This new box on the right hand side is a way of enabling the community to say whether a plugin is compatible with the newest version of WordPress or not. Normally, the plugin information within the FYI box tells you which version of WordPress is required and which version the plugin is compatible up to. Unfortunately, the version the plugin is compatible up to is not updated that often which is why some plugins which state that they only work up to WordPress 2.5 end up working with the latest release. If you have a WordPress.org forum user account, you&#8217;ll need to log in in order to vote. The voting is simple. The first box enables you to select which version of WordPress you&#8217;re running, including the latest version being worked on. The second box allows you to choose which version of the plugin you are running. After setting those two options, you click on the <b>broken</b> or <b>works</b> buttons to place your vote. </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/itworks.png\" alt=\"itworks\" title=\"itworks\" width=\"216\" height=\"257\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6945\" /></p>\n<p>As per the screenshot, the majority of those using WordPress 2.8.5 with version 3.1.7 of the Google XML Sitemaps plugin reported that it&#8217;s working. The beauty of this system is that it leverages the community in order to figure out what works with what. However, just because it works for the majority of users is no guarantee it will work on your particular setup. But using these statistics, it should make it easier to figure out whether the issue is with the plugin and WordPress or with your setup. </p>\n<p>One of the biggest fears users have when it comes time to upgrade WordPress is whether their plugins will work on the newest version or not. There are a large handful of people who upgrade to the latest version of WordPress as soon as it&#8217;s released and the hope is, these folks will visit the plugin page and report their findings for others to take advantage of. If more users see that their plugins work on the newest version, they are more likely to upgrade. </p>\n<p>What are your thoughts on this system? Any ideas to enhance it? </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 27 Oct 2009 17:59:51 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"Joseph: MakeItLink Update\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"http://josephscott.org/archives/2009/10/makeitlink-update/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"http://josephscott.org/archives/2009/10/makeitlink-update/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1207:\"<p>With the upcoming release of WordPress 2.9 I thought this would be a good time to re-sync my <a href=\"http://josephscott.org/archives/2008/11/makeitlink-detecting-urls-in-text-and-making-them-links/\">original MakeItLink PHP class</a>.

driving home today and there was a huge storm all around me, lightning everywhere, very intense lightning, but it was not raining or windy around me.  It reminded me of where I am at in life right now, this insane storm around me changing every second of the day, yet I still had strength, courage and guidance.  God has put his hand in my life and I have seen it more magnified in the past week and a half then ever.  It\'s amazing how safe we are in his hands and how trust is so very hard sometimes, yet has such an overwhelming return.  God is awesome!\n\nLately I\'ve been feeling like things have been crashing down all around me.  Yet, at the same time I feel I have been settling it all in better position than they were before, protected.  Life moves so very fast that once you stop and look at everything going on around you, you realize that this is beyond you, something bigger is in the works and helping you through it all.\n\nIn the last week and a half I was in an accident where my car was totaled, I\'ve made an offer on my first house, I\'ve been given the opportunity to fly up to Penn State for a 3rd interview on site for a fantastic job and I\'ve met a girl beyond my dreams.  All of this while I was sick and feeling physically terrible.\n\nNo one was sent to the hospital from the accident, thank God.  I don\'t have a bruise on my body, not even an ache from the accident, yet looking at my car it seems I should be paralyzed or not even breathing.  Insurance is working beautifully and my loan is taken care of.  This has created an opportunity to buy a better car for less than my previous loan balance.\n\nMy housing search and pre approval went flawlessly and I found a house I am absolutely in love with, perfect location, perfect potential, perfect timing.\n\nIf I wrote a profile of the company I would like to work for, the company for this job has hit all points.  If I get this job, I would be programming from home for an increase in pay, for a company I absolutely love in a great team environment.\n\nI thank God for protecting me and giving me strength to push forward through all this, and knowing he has plan for all of this makes me feel at peace.','Safe In You','Ever feel like your life is surrounded by a storm, yet you are completely protected and you\'ve been given the strength and the courage to push

04:29:35','<div>\r\n\r\nThe name’s Matt Simpson, I’m a soccer ninja, business connoisseur, music engineer and Ruby on Rails a holic.\r\n\r\nMy Life, generally:\r\n\r\nI was born in a small town and raised in a house in the country.  All I had to keep me busy was my brother, best friend, my creativity and the adventures we thought up!  I suppose creativity was a part of my life from the git go.  Probably why I am always churning ideas around and never in boredom.  My boredom contains a canvas and it is never blank.\r\n\r\nI am the youngest of 4, being in that position I grew up very determined, competitive and driven.  Some people tell me I am not a type A but have 2 A’s in my personality.  I love a challenge and figuring out the how to make anything more efficient.  I also love designing and composing music.  With those 2 combinations you get a very interesting person.\r\n\r\nAs far as programming’s concerned, well, It all started in the 4th grade.  What better year to begin programming?  I took a class on QBASIC and my curiosity – on how computers work – began.  It opened my eyes that computers are not just some magical things found in a foreign tiny little island with jungles and monkeys and cobras.  I began developing websites in 7th grade, where I spent some of my time engrossed in developing hideous (now hideous, then genius) websites about my life in the fast junior high culture <img src=\"http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" /> .  Throughout high school I stepped my web development knowledge more and more, bit by bit.  My first paid contract was my junior year in high school for a flash website and it all started to come together as to why I was spending so much time on the computer nights after nights, mornings after early mornings.\r\n\r\nI went to the Art Institute in Schaumburg Illinois majoring in Interactive Media Design in 2006 when I landed a job as a web developer at Wencel Worldwide downtown Chicago.  I quickly realized that with the power of the internet, school was slowing me down in regards to my web development strength.  What I could teach myself in 1 year I would learn at school in 4, and by the time I graduated, what I learned would be obsolete at the exponential rate the internet moves.  I quickly realized if I were to make it in this industry I needed to unleash myself from school so that I could continue to learn the latest and greatest in web development.\r\n\r\nAfter working at Wencel Worldwide full time for a while I landed a job in Saint Louis Missouri as the lead web applications developer at Customer Direct in 2007.  I have been working there as the Lead Ruby on Rails web developer of a team of 4 programmers and 3 systems admins.  I’ve been focusing my efforts on Ruby on Rails, mentoring the other developers, and teaming to develop some very innovative applications.\r\n\r\nIn June of 2008 I started a web development solutions company, Envion Studios LLC, focusing on Ruby on Rails and PHP development.  Since then, numerous opportunities have opened up and blossomed into great growing points in my life.\r\n\r\nI played baseball and soccer in high school.  Started varsity my sophomore, junior and senior year for soccer, loved every minute of the season.  I played the trumpet in marching band, section leader my sophomore, junior and senior years as well.  I truly believe that being a part of sports and marching band has shaped my life more than anything imaginable.\r\n\r\nMusic is a huge part in my life.  I play drums, guitar, piano (primary) and I sing.  Mainly as an outlet of my creativity and of life, but also as a way to express what’s going on inside.  Music is the language of the soul.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this blog, I feel contributing back to the community of the internet is an amazing privilege and I am so glad that the internet has become as powerful of a tool as it has.  I have learned much from it, and only hope to contribute a smidgen of knowledge back.\r\n\r\nFeel free to check out my developer blog at <a title=\"www.railsgrammer.com, my development blog\" href=\"http://railsgrammer.com\" target=\"_blank\">Rails Grammer</a> where I ramble about my life, culture, friendships and my walk with christ.\r\n\r\nThanks and

and there was a huge storm all around me, lightning everywhere, very intense lightning, but it was not raining or windy around me.  It reminded me of where I am at in life right now, this insane storm around me changing every second of the day, yet I still had strength, courage and guidance.  God has put his hand in my life and I have seen it more magnified in the past week and a half then ever.  It\'s amazing how safe we are in his hands and how trust is so very hard sometimes, yet has such an overwhelming return.  God is awesome!\r\n\r\nLately I\'ve been feeling like things have been crashing down all around me.  Yet, at the same time I feel I have been settling it all in better position than they were before, protected.  Life moves so very fast that once you stop and look at everything going on around you, you realize that this is beyond you, something bigger is in the works and helping you through it all.\r\n\r\nIn the last week and a half I was in an accident where my car was totaled, I\'ve made an offer on my first house, I\'ve been given the opportunity to fly up to Penn State for a 3rd interview on site for a fantastic job and I\'ve met a girl beyond my dreams.  All of this while I was sick and feeling physically terrible.\r\n\r\nNo one was sent to the hospital from the accident, thank God.  I don\'t have a bruise on my body, not even an ache from the accident, yet looking at my car it seems I should be paralyzed or not even breathing.  Insurance is working beautifully and my loan is taken care of.  This has created an opportunity to buy a better car for less than my previous loan balance.\r\n\r\nMy housing search and pre approval went flawlessly and I found a house I am absolutely in love with, perfect location, perfect potential, perfect timing.\r\n\r\nIf I wrote a profile of the company I would like to work for, the company for this job has hit all points.  If I get this job, I would be programming from home for an increase in pay,

me feel at peace.','Safe In You','Ever feel like your life is surrounded by a storm, yet you are completely protected and you\'ve been given the strength and the courage to push

The memories that came back were incredible, all you can do is just smile and soak in the details.

I thank God everytime I think about it because there were so many times that I felt too tired to remain enthused on the search but he pulled me through and it is glorious!\r\n\r\nSo, I put in my 2 weeks notice at my current employer, which was very exciting, and my last day is Tuesday the 11th of September (ironic date).\r\n\r\nWhat will I be doing?

Customer Direct outsources customer service for other companies, so my obvious main concern was that their main focus isn\'t programming and development. After the interview I was highly convinced that without a doubt I would be of great importance and that \'product development\' or programming is one of their essential utillities.

I\'ve already decided that I am wanting to give as much time / energy / resources to this ministry as I possibly can, I couldn\'t be more excited. How often do you wish that you could be a part of the beginning of something, or wish that you could become a huge part in a community.\r\n\r\nThat\'s the exactly how I have been feeling lately, I remember back in the day when I used to be active in my church, remembered how it felt to always have something to look forward to every week, and how many awesome people I met and shared experiences. And this time I can be the start of a huge thing in this area, give those with no hope, nothing to look forward to, no one exciting to look forward to meet, I realized that I can be a part of the spark in their lives that gives them their life back, the meaning of it and the love of it. I didn\'t really realize why I did it back in high school not even sure if I though of it, but now that I\'ve grown I can\'t help but think, how many people are out there bored with life, bored with who they know, missing that key element of existance, missing God!\r\n\r\nSo every sunday night after the 5th at 5 (the 5th church service @5 at windsor : church) the college group are hanging out ---- somewhere. Doesn\'t matter where, and it\'s not going to be the same every week. We\'re just going to hang out and do life together. I can\'t wait! till the next get together (which is my bday), just because not only am I growing with others, but this opens a portal for me to finally meet people my own age (Impossible feet at my situation it often seems).\r\n\r\nGod Rocks!','Phew...','','publish','open','open','','phew','','','2009-06-21 16:53:24','2009-06-21 21:53:24','',0,'http://www.coffeencoke.com/?p=62',0,'post','',0),(63,1,'2009-06-21 16:52:31','2009-06-21 21:52:31','','Phew...','','inherit','open','open','','62-revision','','','2009-06-21 16:52:31','2009-06-21 21:52:31','',62,'http://www.coffeencoke.com/2009/06/21/62-revision/',0,'revision','',0),(64,1,'2008-03-24 16:53:29','2008-03-24 21:53:29','<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><a href=\"http://www.coffeencoke.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/2359210097_28f996582e_o.png\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-17\" style=\"margin: 10px;\" title=\"Sword of the spirit\" src=\"http://www.coffeencoke.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/2359210097_28f996582e_o-289x300.png\" alt=\"Sword of the spirit\" width=\"289\" height=\"300\" /></a>Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power.

So it\'s crushed my spirits a little bit, but who knows, maybe i\'ll put it on craig\'s list for 400 bucks and it\'ll be taken out of my hands.\neeeeeek!','Sad news','','inherit','open','open','','76-revision','','','2009-06-21 22:31:09','2009-06-22 03:31:09','',76,'http://www.coffeencoke.com/2009/06/21/76-revision/',0,'revision','',0),(86,1,'2009-06-21 22:31:09','2009-06-22 03:31:09','Breahe You In\nThousand Foot Krutch\n\nTaking hold, breaking in\nThe pressures on, need to circulate\nMesmerized and taken in\nMoving slow, so it resonates\nIt\'s time to rest, not to sleep away\nMy thoughts alone, try to complicate\nI\'ll do my best, to seek you out\nAnd be myself, not impersonate\n\nTried so hard to not walk away\nAnd when things don\'t go my way\nI\'ll still carry on and on just the same\n\nI\'ve always been strong\nBut can\'t make this happen\n\'Cause I need to breathe, I want to breathe you in\nThe fear of becoming\nSo tired of running\nCause I need to breathe, I want to breathe you in\nI want to breathe you in\n\n\nI\'m going in, so cover me\nYour compass will, help me turn the page\nThe laughing stock I\'ll never be\nBecause I won\'t let them take me\n\n\nTried so hard to not walk away\nAnd when things didn\'t go my way\nI\'ll still carry on and on just the same\n\nI\'ve always been strong\nBut can\'t make this happen\n\'Cause I need to breathe, I want to breathe you in\nThe fear of becoming\nSo tired of running\nCause I need to breathe...\n\n\nTook awhile to see all the love that\'s around me\nThrough the highs and lows there\'s a truth that I know\nAnd it\'s You\n\nI  want to breathe you in','Breathe You In','','inherit','open','open','','77-revision','','','2009-06-21 22:31:09','2009-06-22 03:31:09','',77,'http://www.coffeencoke.com/2009/06/21/77-revision/',0,'revision','',0),(87,1,'2009-06-21 22:31:09','2009-06-22 03:31:09','I bought a new car!

existent</strong>, <em>I envy that</em>.  I get so wrapped up on the beginning and end that I spend bulk of my time thinking about the beginning and end or <strong>what\'s next?</strong> rather than living in the moment right now, to the fullest!\r\n\r\nToo often I feel that we focus on the beginning of something only to wonder how long it will last or when it will end just so that we can think or talk about the beginning of something all over again.\r\n\r\nThis could relate to a multitude of things, a few examples? k...\r\n<blockquote>\"<strong>Can\'t wait</strong> till 5 o\'clock rolls around so I can get off work.\"\r\n\"Next Friday I close on my house!\"\r\n\"I\'m sooo hot at Rock the River and this speaking is loud, <strong>how long should I stay?</strong>\"\r\n\"Waiting is so agonizing, how long will I have to wait\"\r\n\"When I get this thing I will be ready\"\r\non and on...</blockquote>\r\n<strong>Don\'t get me wrong</strong>, I think looking forward to things is a great thing and it\'s partly what keeps us moving on some days, like these beautiful Mondays :).  But I also think there\'s a lesson we can learn here from yet again, a child.\r\n\r\nI like the verse where Jesus talks about having a childlike mind and childlike faith:\r\n\r\nMark 10:15\r\n<blockquote>\"I tell you the truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.\"</blockquote>\r\nAlthough this verse is in a slightly different context, I think it still serves for multiple contexts, I think there is a connection that can be made.  Think about how a child plays with their favorite toy, swings, eats, watches a movie, or plays with their celebrity (in their eyes) uncle! :) There is no end in their mind.  They do not think like: \"I\'ll probably play puzzle for the next 5 minutes and then move on to playing with my blocks\" or \"I need to play really hard because pretty soon we\'re leaving and I won\'t be able to play anymore\" or \"I love playing with my uncle and have to play with him and show him everything in the next hour because he\'s leaving then.\"... No, they are in the moment to the fullest, which is how we should be.\r\n\r\nI was at Rock the River yesterday and caught myself thinking, \"<strong>How long</strong> am I staying and <strong>should I just leave now</strong> or leave in a little bit?\".  My question to this is, and my question I am trying to ask myself frequently is, <strong>\"Am I living in the moment, right now?\"</strong>\r\n\r\nIt\'s a very simple question and it\'s very easy to remember and constantly ask yourself and I think it is going to help me enjoy the <em>not so ecstatic</em> events in my life and make all events fullfilling and enjoyable.  I think I will begin building deeper relationships with some other friends that I never would have opened up because I will no longer be thinking of the <em>next ecstatic</em> event but will be living it all in the moment right now!\r\n\r\nidk, I know this will help me because I have a lot of really good high energy moments and I have a few low energy moments where I\'m only present physically for no particular reason.  I hope this helps me be more conscience of my mood and presence wherever I may be.  How we act affects our relationships 1 of 2 ways, positive or negative, there is no neutral reaction, if you could be aware of weather you are creating a negative reaction based on your mood would you be more inspired to do something about it!?  I would.\r\n\r\nThere is no part of me that wants to create a negative vibe ever!  Yet I do, occasionally, but this should help me, maybe it\'ll help you too.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think in the <strong>comments</strong>, on <strong><a title=\"Follow Me\" href=\"http://twitter.com/coffeencoke\" target=\"_blank\">twitter (@coffeencoke)</a></strong>.  Also you can <strong>subscribe</strong> to my posts via the <strong>rss feed</strong>, or if you create a login you can <strong>subscribe and get email notifications</strong>.  Just fyi :)','Begining and End','','publish','open','open','','begining-and-end','','','2009-08-03 11:15:06','2009-08-03 16:15:06','',0,'http://www.coffeencoke.com/?p=108',0,'post','',2),(109,1,'2009-08-03 11:06:07','2009-08-03 16:06:07','Children\'s view of beginning and end is <strong>non existent</strong>, <em>I envy that</em>.  I get so wrapped up on the beginning and end that I spend bulk of my time thinking about the beginning and end or <strong>what\'s next?</strong> rather than living in the moment right now, to the fullest!\n\nToo often I feel that we focus on the beginning of something only to wonder how long it will last or when it will end just so that we can think or talk about the beginning of something all over again.\n\nThis could relate to a multitude of things, a few examples? k...\n<blockquote>\"<strong>Can\'t wait</strong> till 5 o\'clock rolls around so I can get off work.\"\n\"Next Friday I close on my house!\"\n\"I\'m sooo hot at Rock the River and this speaking is loud, <strong>how long should I stay?</strong>\"\n\"Waiting is so agonizing, how long will I have to wait\"\n\"When I get this thing I will be ready\"\non and on...</blockquote>\n<strong>Don\'t get me wrong</strong>, I think looking forward to things is a great thing and it\'s partly what keeps us moving on some days, like these beautiful Mondays :).  But I also think there\'s a lesson we can learn here from yet again, a child.\n\nI like the verse where Jesus talks about having a childlike mind and childlike faith:\n\nMark 10:15\n<blockquote>\"I tell you the truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.\"</blockquote>\nAlthough this verse is in a slightly different context, I think it still serves for multiple contexts, I think there is a connection that can be made.  Think about how a child plays with their favorite toy, swings, eats, watches a movie, or plays with their celebrity (in their eyes) uncle! :) There is no end in their mind.  They do not think like: \"I\'ll probably play puzzle for the next 5 minutes and then move on to playing with my blocks\" or \"I need to play really hard because pretty soon we\'re leaving and I won\'t be able to play anymore\" or \"I love playing with my uncle and have to play with him and show him everything in the next hour because he\'s leaving then.\"...

Second Saturday is an event put on through my church, Windsor Crossing, that takes place every second Saturday of the month from 815 – 2ish. We go to u-city and help improve the city by fixing up houses, cleaning up the area, making time for conversation with those in need and reaching out to the community. I have not done much volunteering at any church so this was a big step for me. I’ve always considered myself an active church member, but I suppose that was limited to going to groups and meeting people and hanging out. I feel I’m making a transformation where the world doesn’t revolve around me, where my life is an instrument, and I am not the dictator anymore! I feel that God is moving the pieces into place and positioning me and I’m super excited to see what happens and what we can do.\r\n\r\nPeace

the light of God bursting out of it, that it will be a place of direction in people\'s lives and a place for growth and foundation.\r\n\r\nI meet with my contractor on Monday to plan out the schedule for the construction on the house.  I\'m having the following done:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Carpet in the basement</li>\r\n	<li>Refinish the stairs</li>\r\n	<li>Carpet the bedrooms</li>\r\n	<li>Update the flooring upstairs</li>\r\n	<li>New windows</li>\r\n	<li>New Furnace / AC / Thermostat</li>\r\n	<li>New door</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nI\'m also having a house warming party where some friends and I will get together and write prayers and encouragement on the floors and walls before they are finished and a party to paint the house.  I plan on moving in to the house 2 - 3 weeks from now, for the time being I am blessed enough to have a sister and family to let me crash at their house temporarily.\r\n\r\nThanks for your prayers and words of encouragement.  God has definitely been at work throughout all of this.','Over That Mountain','','publish','open','open','','over-that-mountain','','','2009-08-13 21:55:36','2009-08-14

tunnel, it is SO close.  Started out painting 2 weeks ago and the entire inside of the house was getting painted (roughly 2400 sq. ft.).  That\'s a lot of paint!  We\'ve been doing 2 coats for everything and all we have left after tonight is 2 walls in the living room and dining room, the upstairs bathroom and the small bedroom.  The plan is to finish painting those tomorrow and do some touch up work and be completely done with painting before we go to bed tomorrow night, spend all of Saturday day cleaning and preparing for unpacking and organizing then finally enjoy a case of Corona on my deck watching the sunset.  Can we make it?  I pray God will give us the energy and discipline to get it done.\r\n\r\nI couldn\'t be happier with how the paint has taken shape in the house, the

painting, keep in mind I still have been waking up to work at 7 every morning :).  The house is finally begininning to look like a home and I can see the light at the end of the tunnel, it is SO close.  Started out painting 2 weeks ago and the entire inside of the house was getting painted (roughly 2400 sq. ft.).  That\'s a lot of paint!  We\'ve been doing 2 coats for everything and all we have left after tonight is 2 walls in the living room and dining room, the upstairs bathroom and the small bedroom.  The plan is to finish painting those tomorrow and do some touch up work and be completely done with painting before we go to bed tomorrow night, spend all of Saturday day cleaning and preparing for unpacking and organizing then finally enjoy a case of Corona on my deck watching the sunset.  Can we make it?  I pray God will give us the energy and discipline to get it done.\r\n\r\nI couldn\'t be happier with how the paint has taken shape in the house, the colors, placement and

God - In order for this to happen, I don\'t want it to become because we are fenomenal at marketing or spreading the word of the event, it must happen because God wills it and is the purpose of it.\r\n\r\n2. A very very strong core team - The worship will be organic and not feel like a song set, the worship leader will play whatever song he/she feels the Holy Spirit is leading them to.  In order to do this, a band with good experience and love of a large list of worship songs, an experienced leader who can discern what song to play next or lead in to would be, an experienced band who can follow the leader\'s song suggestions, a tech team who can pull up the words to the song quickly, all of these things are needed and need a strong core team.\r\n\r\n3. Recognition - people come from all over in their walk with Christ and come back again and again!\r\n\r\n4. A beginning - This vision will not happen from the start.  It will take time and prayer and listening, training, following and yielding to God.  As I mentioned earlier, the team will need to be very experienced and that takes time.  The originality requires patience and the boldness to just start doing it.\r\n\r\nSo where do we start?  After much discussion and brainstorming the best place to start is to just start having worship parties at a place and time and continue to do it.  Pray about it and as God to guide and direct this.  All we need is someone with a guitar, a voice and some worship songs.  After talking with folks on the team at Windsor, my church, the recommendation is to get a bunch of people and just start getting together at a house and do just that, worship, pray, rejoice, praise and grow.\r\n\r\nSo that\'s what we\'re going to do!  This Friday from 10 - 12 at my house, you\'re all invited let me know if you\'d like to come and I\'ll give you more details.  I pray that God will give me the boldness to begin and that he will be in this.  That all who come will love and be loved, and that we can all grow together.\r\n\r\nIf you have any feedback, please let me know by either commenting, emailing me, a phone call or in person, I would love to gain any feedback you may have.  And please pray for this, it has been on my heart for a long long time and it\'s exciting and scary at the same time.  I cannot believe that I am actually planning this instead of just talking about it.\r\n\r\nThank you God for this house you have given me, to have the room and the privacy (sound wise) to do this and thank you for placing this vision in my heart, give me strength, courage and a yielding heart for this.  Amen.','House of Worship','','publish','open','open','','house-of-worship','','','2009-09-27 02:50:00','2009-09-27 07:50:00','',0,'http://www.coffeencoke.com/?p=152',0,'post','',1),(153,1,'2009-09-27 02:47:27','2009-09-27 07:47:27','','worship','','inherit','open','open','','worship','','','2009-09-27 02:47:27','2009-09-27 07:47:27','',152,'http://www.coffeencoke.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/worship.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(154,1,'2009-09-27 02:45:07','2009-09-27 07:45:07','This Friday I will be hosting the first ever Praisin Jesus Party at my house.

been coming up about how God works through us in astonishing ways, more specifically through our non christ like experiences.\r\n\r\nWhen I was younger I used to party a lot and was apart of a lot of things that I do not allow to be in my life anymore, such as drinking, girls, language, distasteful jokes, etc.  I\'ve gone through series of phases in my life where I was a christian during those experiences, to choosing to no longer take part in those activities but still wanting to, to seeing my friends and others live that life and saying to myself \"Man, they are totally missing out and they don\'t even know it!\".  Others may look at people who party till they puke and smoke and sleep around and will judge, disrespect or totally miss the fact that they ARE our brothers and sisters and they simply are lost.\r\n\r\nI feel God has given me those experiences so that I have a deep desire in my heart to lead them to the voice of truth and love.  I could have easily gotten into deep trouble when I was living that life, like being arrested, injured, addicted, or getting myself into a situation of getting someone pregnant or worse!  Yet I was protected through it all!  God protected me so that I can be the man I am today, freed with the only truth and love that satisfies that emptiness I, and so many others, searched for.  We search for them in all the wrong places only to find ourselves to continue to search in what seems to be a never ending labyrinth.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone else feel this way?  That God may have allowed us to experience what we did and protected us so that we can have a deep longing to later look at others and desire to show them how they can finally fill that emptiness?\r\n\r\nI pray; God give us the strength and control to be in this world but not of it, to act upon the desires in our hearts to search for those who are lost and lead them to you!  Give me the understanding and help me be humble in that I am NOT better than those who are lost.','Bad Experiences For Good','','publish','open','open','','bad-experiences-for-good','','','2009-10-24 00:47:36','2009-10-24

there were 13 of us praising the crap out of Jesus, the only one who deserves our praise.  Earlier this week, it was tough for me to imagine how to even begin this night and I just laid it in God\'s hands because he is in control of this vision I have, and it was more amazing and truly a memorable night.  Thanks for all of you who shared this experience with me, I am looking forward to more of these nights.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I pray that these nights create a stronger community and deeper relationships with each other and with our Lord and Savior.  I pray that the community and relationships we build from this grow with the desire to go out in the world and illuminate God\'s Glory onto the world, and that these nights will light a fire in our hearts to share Jesus with everyone we connect with at any level.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I heard somewhere, don\'t quite remember where but it goes something like:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"text-align: left;\">How have we become so afraid to share Jesus with others that we often times crawl into our corner and completely ignore the topic around others all together.  If there were someone standing in the street and I saw a car coming toward him, but he didn\'t see the car, I would do everything I could to scream out to him and tell him about the car blazing to hit him.  Why are we not like this when it comes to something far more important than a car coming after you, Jesus is there for us always yet we so often forget or refuse to let others know of his gift.</blockquote>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">How true and profane is that?!?  We should want to tell someone about our Savior Jesus like a car is coming to hit them and they don\'t know it and more!</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Take that and chew on it for a bit.</p>','First of many was amazing','','inherit','open','open','','158-revision-3','','','2009-10-03 03:00:25','2009-10-03

do?\r\n\r\n[ truly think about what you would do]\r\n\r\nSection 2\r\n\r\nNow that you\'ve thought about it a bit and hopefully have an answer, do you think that\'s right?  Meaning do you think it\'s humane or based upon social standard or is it the culturally common thing to do?\r\n\r\nSection 3\r\n\r\nWhat do you think Jesus would do?  Was your answer anywhere close to what Jesus would do?  If not then why, if so then why did you not answer with a more cultural answer and why do you think the cultural answer, or in other words, the immediate instinctive answer is so barbaric?\r\n\r\nThere are SO many things and ideas that can spawn off of where we are now, when do you think anger is an OK emotion, do you think it\'s right to allow someone else to control your emotions, if God created anger for a purpose what is that purpose and how do we control ourselves to using anger for only what it is designed for?  I could write pages of things we could talk spawning from where we are on a conversation topic level!\r\n\r\nI encourage you to bring this up to a close friend.  When discussing this, it IS very important to pause and talk about each section naturally like it\'s not a process.  Reason I say close friend is because I think this is something that could open up a very deep conversation to allow quite a bit of growth between two people.  It allows a lot of inward

saint louis ;) -  Maybe for the fact to stimulate your mind or sounds smart or the big one - to grow in your relationship with that other person by discussing deeper topics other than how\'s work?  I long for this every day and wanted to share something with you.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In the last month I\'ve had numerous conversations with good friends, this time instigated by yours truly, about something that has been on my mind, a lot lately.  Let\'s say it simply intrigues me to the ultimate and back.  Like a package of oreos, i can\'t let a package of oreos just sit there and go untouched, and most the time, I have to eat the entire package!  So this intrigues me like a new package of oreos...</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Notable: This would be most effective if you only read and processed one section at a time (they\'re short and few).  I know it would be very tempting and easy to read the entire post or none of it :) but I challenge you to take a moment or a few moments throughout the next week and read bits of this post.  See what may happens.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I hope this post will be as intriguing to you as 20 hopeful oreos!  I would even go as far as recommend you to read the first section and walk away from this post so you can think about it and come back for the next section.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Let Us Begin! - I would really appreciate an email or text or comment if you wish about this cause I\'m crazy curious about it.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Section 1</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">do not read section 2 until you\'ve fully thought about this.  It may come as a shock to you for how short and initially comical it may seem to you:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you were present and some random guy / girl walked up to your mother and punched her out, what would you do?</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">[ truly think about what you would do]</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Section 2</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Now that you\'ve thought about it a bit and hopefully have an answer, do you think that\'s right?  Meaning do you think it\'s humane or based upon social standard or is it the culturally common thing to do?</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Section 3</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">What do you think Jesus would do?  Was your answer anywhere close to what Jesus would do?  If not then why, if so then why did you not answer with a more cultural answer and why do you think the cultural answer, or in other words, the immediate instinctive answer is so barbaric?</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">There are SO many things and ideas that can spawn off of where we are now, when do you think anger is an OK emotion, do you think it\'s right to allow someone else to control your emotions, if God created anger for a purpose what is that purpose and how do we control ourselves to using anger for only what it is designed for?  I could write pages of things we could talk spawning from where we are on a conversation topic level!</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I encourage you to bring this up to a close friend.  When discussing this, it IS very important to pause and talk about each section naturally like it\'s not a process.  Reason I say close friend is because I think this is something that could open up a very deep conversation to allow quite a bit of growth between two people.  It allows a lot of inward thinking and reflection which I think is a great way to grow.  One of my deep desires is to grow in my relationships with other people through Christ and his word.  Need I say more?  I love how simple this is too!</p>','Profound -

There are many many many roads to walk on and many diversions to take so how do you know where to go?  The way I view planning is: How can you plan a trip or a destination accurately without planning either in the beginning of the trip or along the way?  If you drive through the country with no plan you drive aimlessly with no direction, goal and quite honestly a feeling of empty accomplishment - but that\'s an accomplishment right!?!?  It is the same with your very own life!</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">One thing I\'ve been questioning and churning in my head lately is when to plan and when to let God direct me.  I\'ve always been a planner, however I have learned to leave space open for spontaneity, otherwise I will grow frustrated and disappointed that I am not able to be involved with certain things.  Also having space for spontaneous events allows time to reflect and experiment with things that are new to you in the now and weren\'t ever considered for planning in the past.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">All that wasn\'t new for me but the big question on my mind was \"Is it healthy, spiritually, for me to plan my life with such hope, desire and aspirations?\", because from talking with others I will mention I plan on - and later have the feeling that I NEED to say, \"if it\'s God\'s will\", or \"if God directs me to follow that plan\", etc.  When I get that feeling to say that I begin questioning why, naturally.  The question to answer the why is \"What kind of planning is healthy?  Can I be at peace of mind and feel like I am allowing God to direct my life if I continue to plan?\".</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">After searching, I found a lot of scripture to help me figure this out, the main one I appreciated and that helped me answer this particular thought was Proverbs 16.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 10px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-left: 10px; overflow-x: auto; overflow-y: auto;

ways seem innocent to him,\r\nbut motives are weighed by the LORD.\r\n\r\n<sup>3</sup> Commit to the LORD whatever you do,\r\nand your plans will succeed.\r\n\r\n<sup>4</sup> The LORD works out everything for his own ends—\r\neven the wicked for a day of disaster.\r\n\r\n<sup>5</sup> The LORD detests all the proud of heart.\r\nBe sure of this: They will not go unpunished.\r\n\r\n<sup>6</sup> Through love and faithfulness sin is atoned for;\r\nthrough the fear of the LORD a man avoids evil.\r\n\r\n<sup>7</sup> When a man\'s ways are pleasing to the LORD,\r\nhe makes even his enemies live

man who speaks the truth.\r\n\r\n<sup>14</sup> A king\'s wrath is a messenger of death,\r\nbut a wise man will appease it.\r\n\r\n<sup>15</sup> When a king\'s face brightens, it means life;\r\nhis favor is like a rain cloud in spring.\r\n\r\n<sup>16</sup> How much better to get wisdom than gold,\r\nto choose understanding rather than silver!\r\n\r\n<sup>17</sup> The highway of the upright avoids evil;\r\nhe who guards his way guards his life.\r\n\r\n<sup>18</sup> Pride goes before destruction,\r\na haughty spirit before a fall.\r\n\r\n<sup>19</sup> Better to be lowly in spirit and among the oppressed\r\nthan to share plunder with the proud.\r\n\r\n<sup>20</sup> Whoever gives heed to instruction prospers,\r\nand blessed is he who trusts in the LORD.\r\n\r\n<sup>21</sup> The wise in heart are called discerning,\r\nand pleasant words promote instruction. <sup>[<a title=\"See footnote a\" href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+16&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-16862a\">a</a>]</sup>\r\n\r\n<sup>22</sup> Understanding is a fountain of life to those who have it,\r\nbut folly brings punishment to fools.\r\n\r\n<sup>23</sup> A wise man\'s heart guides his mouth,\r\nand his lips promote instruction. <sup>[<a title=\"See footnote b\" href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+16&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-16864b\">b</a>]</sup>\r\n\r\n<sup>24</sup> Pleasant words are a honeycomb,\r\nsweet to the soul and healing to the bones.\r\n\r\n<sup>25</sup> There is a way that seems right to a man,\r\nbut in the end it leads to death.\r\n\r\n<sup>26</sup> The laborer\'s appetite works for him;\r\nhis hunger drives him on.\r\n\r\n<sup>27</sup> A scoundrel plots evil,\r\nand his speech is like a scorching fire.\r\n\r\n<sup>28</sup> A perverse man stirs up dissension,\r\nand a gossip separates close friends.\r\n\r\n<sup>29</sup> A violent man entices his neighbor\r\nand leads him down a path that is not good.\r\n\r\n<sup>30</sup> He who winks with his eye is plotting perversity;\r\nhe who purses his lips is bent on evil.\r\n\r\n<sup>31</sup> Gray hair is a crown of splendor;\r\nit is attained by a righteous life.\r\n\r\n<sup>32</sup> Better a patient man than a warrior,\r\na man who controls his temper than one who takes a city.\r\n\r\n<sup>33</sup> The lot is cast into the lap,\r\nbut its every decision is from the LORD.</blockquote>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Especially verse 9: \"In his heart a man plans his course, but the LORD determines his steps.\"  This made me see more clearly that planning IS good and healthy for you but planning doesn\'t mean it\'s set in stone and that\'s what\'s happening, there\'s 2 pieces in planning in order to make it practical to your life, there\'s planning and the determination of that plan.  The key is allowing God to determine your plans and have sovereignty over your plan.  The best way I understand this is, God doesn\'t want to micromanage you and he is the creator of creativity, he wants you to be creative and have desires of your own and to use your creativity to plan ahead.  But just like a great father that he is, he desires to be involved in the decision of your plans, and again like a great father he is, he allows you to invite him into the decisions.  How awesome is it that he loves us so much that not only has he given us an excellent example of the relationship we have with him - father and son - but he allows US to decide.  HE hopes, desires and aspires that we love HIM so much and value HIM so much that we involve HIM.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">That is simply amazing.</p>','Destined
