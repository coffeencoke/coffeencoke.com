Requestful Thinking

Been having discussions about the use of MongoDB and PostgreSQL.  Has anyone come across any benchmarks for these 2.  We've been making a lot of benchmarks using MongoDB with a solution we need, the difference is not a magnitude off from other db's.  I love mongodb but also have had a love for sql oriented database in the past.

I would love to hear what others feel about non sql based databases in certain application solutions.

What are your thoughts on...
